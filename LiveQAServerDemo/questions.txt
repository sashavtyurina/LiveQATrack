<message>QID: YA:20150609113532AACm5Oo TITLE:  Why are people so ignorant about poor eyesight? BODY: I took a pencil in my right eye when I was in elementary school. This caused light sensitivity. I have Keratoconus, and my allergies to a lot of things have had me scratching my eyes and worsening the problem, the rest of my life.  Because of this, my eyesight is around 20/400. The optometrist can only correct my eyesight so much. I can't see distances at all. I am nearsighted. I can see very well up close. Because I am more familiar with close things, I don't wear the glasses all the time.  When I put them on, I can't see near things.  I get the following from people constantly: Just put your glasses on and you can see! Well if you're so blind you should be wearing glasses. And when I explain to them the glasses only do so much: You need to go back to get your vision checked and get new glasses! Get lasik eye surgery!  I can't afford lasik eye surgery. The last eye specialist I saw told me that if I didn't pay into the thousands of dollars it would take to have a surgery where they slice open my eyeballs and implant cones, I would be blind in my 40s.  Do people not understand what going blind even means? I tell them it's happening, they simply don't listen. CATEGORY: Optical </message>

<message>QID: YA:20150609120035AAiQoEe TITLE:  Keep hair healthy that has been plucked off (Hair science, hair care)? BODY: My gf left me and all I have left of her are two long blonde hairs I found on the bathroom floor. Just over 2 feet in length (individually), very soft. She used a very distinctive smelling Bath &amp; Body works lotion that I picked up from the store. So I can I dip them in her lotion and wisp the hairs along my cheek and below my nose and imagine her.  But I'm afraid that they will get brittle or break up unless I take good care of them. I was going to buy some special conditioner, put it on my fingers, and run their hair through my pressed fingers several times a day. But I got to thinking- is there a special way to take care of them since they are not attached to someone's head and thus "plucked".  Is it the same as when you pluck a flower? Should I preserve them in water when I'm not playing with them to keep the moisture up? Give some beauty tips for my two hairs- to make them (1) last and (2) stay soft.  Also- if someone has the money, is there a biotechnology service to grow cloned hairs? I know the follicle itself is dead cells but one of the strands seems to have the base as well, which I believe holds DNA. Currently the two hairs are about 1 month old.

He was finals mvp &amp; he's back. He's not better than Jordan. In that case, why don't you hate every player today? You used to use the fact that he has no rings to your advantage but you can't now.

I've had two extractions and they started the work for a crown. I had all of these procedures done at separate times not all at once. Both times I had the extractions I ended up with dry socket. My dentist said that if you get dry socket once you are more likely to get it again. Well on Monday I have to go back to the dentist to finish the crown work and have another extraction as well as a cavity filled. For some reason I'm very freaked out by it all this time. The dry sockets are so painful. Does anyone have any suggestions to ease my anxiety. I'm pretty sure if I ask for the "laughing gas " they will give it to me but I'm just really dreading it all but will be glad at the same time when it's over. He usually gives me pain medication for afterwards but my body acts strange to it and I end up with a ton of energy instead of feeling sleepy. Then after a couple days I have to go back for more medicine cause the dry socket will have set in. I tend to get nauseas from the pain meds and antibiotics so I'm hoping he will write me a prescription for nausea medication too. What helps everyone else when they have a bunch of dental work done.

I try to cover it up by dying it brown over and over again but it never works. And obviously my hair is getting damaged, too. I've tried silver shampoo, stripping my hair and dying it dark brown over and over again. Does anyone know how I can get rid of this problem permanently?

<message>QID: YA:20150607104013AAcd1XM TITLE:  Should I report her to her boss for this? BODY: I had a roommate for over a year. I just moved out a few weeks ago because she was trying to control what I did. I have a cat and I noticed that whenever my cat was out in the common area and my roommate would go out there my cat would come running back to my room. I wasn't really sure why exactly. Well, since we have been at my new apartment where it's just me and my cat, I have noticed my cat being scared when I make certain movements. The other day I was holding a spatula in my hand and she was looking at all scared. I bent down and let her smell it and she walked away. Same thing happened when I held a bag of potatoes in my hand. I started to wonder if my roommate ever hit her or did anything to her and that's why she would run to my room away from her.  My roommate is a teacher for 1st graders. This has started to make me worried that if she can potentially harm a cat then who is to say she isn't doing it to her students...? I am a victim of child abuse and do not tolerate this type of behavior. If I see something is off then I report it immediately. However, I am just going on speculation here and am wondering if I should even say something since I don't have proof exactly to say that she might be harming her students in any way. Do you think I should do something? Maybe submit an anonymous tip for the school board to keep a close eye on her just in case? Thanks! CATEGORY: Cats </message>

I noticed an open sore, which I'm assuming was his incision. I think he has licked it open. It's not bleeding or anything, but it sure isn't a pleasant sight. I've read online that you can try to put clothing on them (which I tried, but it didn't work, the clothes ended up falling off.) and I don't have a cone or anything to put around his neck. If his wound stays open is it going to get infected? What should I do? If anyone wants to see the picture I can put it up, I just decided not to for now because I didn't want to gross anyone out.

You can't really tell because of the lighting, but there are strands of BLUE I did not ask for blue! The woman also TEASED my hair before applying the bleach so that it didn't leave a clear indication of where the dye started and where my natural color ended on my hair?? It left in streaks of my normal hair in-between the dyed ones!! It looks disgusting. I also asked to get only my tips dyed but she dyed more than half my head on one side and half my head on the other, they don't match. She put in three different shades when I asked for one specific one. I got my money back and all but, I'm still very angry. How should I go about fixing this? Should I do it myself?

BODY: A few months ago my female cat somehow got let outside by someone in my house and didn't come back for nearly a month. When she finally a came back, a few weeks later we found out she was pregnant. (We were planning on getting her fixed before she ran away.) She had 5 beautiful little kittens 3 months ago, and I've grown such an attachment to each. But I know I can't keep them all because I already have 4 dogs and a indoor kitty. I don't want to just give them to anyone, but someone who will have them indoors and hopefully love them just as much as I do. It breaks my heart to have to separate them, nonetheless give them away but I can't have my house full of animals. (I would if it were my choice.) How can I insure they get a safe home? I just wish I could keep them all but it just wouldn't work, I'm so heartbroken that I have to give them away. CATEGORY: Cats </message>

I'll get in bed and she'll get in bed with me. The doors to my room are closed, except one that leads to the bathroom, where her litter box is. She sleeps for a few hours and she'll wake up and jump on me and if I don't pay attention, she bites. How can I get her to let me sleep?  Secondly, she also bites during normal times. We can be playing around and she'll scratch and bite. I want to play with her and I know cats tend to scratch a lot. I don't want to play if she's going to hurt me. Is there a way to get her to stop?  Lastly, she gets on the dining room table and the countertops in my house. Is there a way to keep her down from those?

<message>QID: YA:20150607123637AAFVD3s TITLE:  Would it be a good idea to get a new cat? BODY: My mom had our last cat murdered. She put him to sleep because he was going on the ground, the vet said it was behavioral, but offered her meds for it, she said no. He was only 10. I think he was doing it to get attention and to copy how I felt. He had been more distant lately and so have I, it's because my mom is such a cruel and harsh person. She is always hurting me and yells at me often. I just sit in my room and cry. The isolation is driving me insane, in my last cat's hay day he could always make me feel better and never left my side. He'd still be that way if my mom wasn't home. She was so harsh to the cat, purposely locking him outside, pushing him away, etc. My mom is never home, she is either at the bar or working and during the school year I don't get home until 2:30. I took on more of the cat as I got older, by the time he died she only gave him water and picked up his droppings if I wasn't home. CATEGORY: Cats </message>

I'm really interested what really happened to these people. I mean there were many genocides committed throughout the history but neither of these managed to perish any race.

BODY: I have a 15 year old long-furred male grey-tabby cat, we know he has hyperthyroidism because he has all of the symptoms and his sibling (brother from the same litter) was diagnosed with it.  He was born outside and unfortunately he is feral and mean.  He has made some progress over the years and will let us pet him and will lay near us, but other times he scratches you out of nowhere, hisses, bites, doesn't let you pick him up, and the one time I did pick him up he scratched me in the face.  He's lost a lot of weight and now he's about 4 - 7 pounds.  In the past we tried to take him to the vet once but he escaped and hid and refused to let us put him in the carrier, he was like 17 pounds then.  Every time he uses the litter box now it's diarrhea, and sometimes he cries in pain.  I'm considering finding a way to somehow get him in the carrier and put him to sleep.  He isn't "dying" yet.  He's still walking normally and getting around fine.  I love him and wanted him to live as long as possible, but I can tell we're probably within the last month of his life.

BODY: As down the glen one Easter morn to a city fair rode I There Armed lines of marching men in squadrons passed me by No fife did hum nor battle drum did sound it's dread tatoo But the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell rang out through the foggy dew  Right proudly high over Dublin Town they hung out the flag of war 'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than at Sulva or Sud El Bar And from the plains of Royal Meath strong men came hurrying through While Britannia's Huns, with their long range guns sailed in through the foggy dew  'Twas Britannia bade our Wild Geese go that small nations might be free But their lonely graves are by Sulva's waves or the shore of the Great North Sea Oh, had they died by Pearse's side or fought with Cathal Brugha Their names we will keep where the fenians sleep 'neath the shroud of the foggy dew  But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell rang mournfully and clear For those who died that Eastertide in the springing of the year And the world did gaze, in deep amaze, at those fearless men, but few Who bore the fight that freedom's light might shine through the foggy dew  Ah, back through the glen I rode again and my heart with grief was sore For I parted then with valiant men whom I never shall see more But to and fro in my dreams I go and I'd kneel and pray for you, For slavery fled, O glorious dead, When you fell in the foggy dew.

Yesterday I bought it's a 10 miracle mask and bunch of oils. My hair has been bleached few times and I have colored my hair at home and at the salon.... I stopped coloring my hair for a while and will for a long time. What can I do??? My hairdresser recommend to stop washing my hair everyday and which I'm doing and to apply coconut oil very often. Does anyone have this problem? I don't to cut all my hair off. My hair is literally now up to my shoulders. My hair feels healthy and looks shine but it's my ends that is the problem. Yesterday I put the 10 miracle mask and then put coconut oil. And my ends are still a mess and yesterday I just got 4 inches off...  Why do my ends keep splitting and breaking???

Only problem is, I've been looking around for colored toric lenses, but they're extremely difficult to find. The brands that I've found that do make them, such as Desio and Solotica  require 4-6 weeks of processing time before they ship out, which is understandable because they're custom made. Is it okay for me to wear non-toric colored contacts such as the Freshlook Colorblend ones (these are the most affordable and accessible)? The Toric Freshlooks have been discontinued I believe, so I'm talking about the regular prescription ones. I understand if they're uncomfortable, I just want to know if they'll irritate or damage my eyes any before I go ahead and buy them. This event I want to wear them to is only a few hours long.  Here's my prescription (I wear the Bioinfinity Toric monthlies): BC: 8.7 DIA: 14.5 PWR: -7.50 CYL: -0.75 x 170 (left eye 170, right eye 180)  Thanks. CATEGORY: Optical </message>

<message>QID: YA:20150607201809AActN2U TITLE:  How much of each paycheck should I be saving? BODY: I'm a college student and have recently decided that after I graduate in two years, I really want to reward myself by getting my teeth fixed... I've yet to meet with dentists for consultations, but I have a family friend who is a dentist and she speculates that I will probably need slight orthodontic work, a crown, and some lasering for my gums; I'm not sure how much it is all going to cost me, but I anticipate that it's going to be quite expensive.  I have a part-time job where I make about two dollars over minimum wage; I want to start saving up so that I can afford my dental work in two years. Can anyone give me any general tips for saving? How much of each paycheck (roughly speaking) should go into savings in order to make a difference in the future?  Thanks in advance for any help! CATEGORY: Dental </message>

He was pretty much stuck in my room for most of the time, due to my dad i was not suppose to have any more cats but my mom let me get him for my birthday. So it was just pretty much us for a couple of months till my dad found out and was okay with him. Now my cat is a mostly outdoor cat. Please no hate for that hes okay and we leave kinda alone on a hill without much danger. So i noticed he only does this to me i will walk outside and he will wait and start running and grab my ankles bite and scratch me he never does it to anyone else just me and sometimes when i pet him he wraps around my arm and hand and just got nuts and bites me over. I pretty much have to leave my hand cause if i pull his claws dig in. So why does he only really attack me? he comes when i call him no matter where he is and he loves sometimes not always loves me holding him. We climb trees together and run around outside. So why only me? He is a social cat loves people loves my family he goes out and greets people walking by. But to be honest i have never really seen him attack anybody else why only me??

Its basically a typical slickback with the sides very short yet blended into the top. Ive got about 4 inches on top, maybe 5. my hair is very thick, if i towel dry it, it looks like a very rough giant fluff ball. Cant see my hair strands unless your in my face. So i need advice on a daily routine, I wash my hair about every other day.  I use a strong gel or pomade/styling paste to slick it back, some days i use only leave in conditioner, which when applied to damp hair combed back creates a decent hold. not long enough yet to kind of just lay back on its own. So i have products in my hair everyday. What do i do at night ? by the end of the night you cant tell anything is in my hair anymore, but it still is. If i run my hand through it enough i can still feel somewhat of a sticky feeling on my hands. (I dont use enormous amounts of any of the three i use, probably nickle size, SOMETIMES quarter size depending on the day) 4 to 5 inches doesnt sound like alot of hair especially with the sides of my hair shaved, but my hair is SO thick.  i do use completely natural shampoo so thats not an issue. I know i should probably wash my hair less, maybe 2-3 times a week, but what about the products still in my hair ? What do i do about that before bed ? I just need advice on a routine regarding the products i listed. as i use them everyday. Trying to grow my hair out faster and feel like this may be slowng it down CATEGORY: Hair </message>

<message>QID: YA:20150608013937AAjMPQf TITLE:  My cat might be suffering something in his tummy.? BODY: My cat is 5-6 weeks old. I adopted him a week ago. Because he was too week the vet gave him a vitamin B shot and prescribed a calcium syrup for him (Sansovit). He spits I every time I try to give him, I tried inserting the syringe as deep as I can so he’s forces to swallow, but he still spits it. From my observation during the past week he strained while pooping and sometimes strained and didn’t poop. The vet said he might have constipation but his poop (Greenish yellow) doesn’t seem to be dry at all. I feed him boiled eggs, chicken breasts, boiled rice. What else can I add to his diet to get the nutrition he needs? I can’t get him wet food or go to the vet for a few days. I fed him Tune once or so. Yesterday, he ate chicken bones for the first time he managed to get one while I was outdoors. When I got back home his tummy was a bit bloated (or so it seemed) it did look and feel a bit larger but I’m not sure. I read cats poop once or twice a day average. Casper defecates once everyday or two days. 24 hours could pass without defecating. However, he pees normally. Yesterday, for the first time he defecated 3 times through 8 hours and once more a few hours later 4 times in total during less than 24 hours is this normal? I was watching him sleeping yesterday for a while I thought he’s breathing fast I don’t know if it was the normal rate but then he actually started breathing rather rapidly for a few seconds and then back to normal. Also, I don’t know whether he is dehydrated or not but how can I prevent dehydration he doesn’t seem to be drinking often. And what do I do if he’s dehydrated. I’ll take him to the vet soon but unless it’s an emergency or something that can really go wrong I can’t take him for a few days. CATEGORY: Cats </message>

But the question and the information: I have to make a total of 360 hours of internship in a maxiumum of 10 weeks and working 5 days a week with 8 hours per day due to laws, when I reachthe required 360 hours I'll have vacation.  So far I have made +-260 hours (261 to be exact) in 6 weeks, how many weeks+days would I have to make if I work 8 hours a day? And if I were to make 7 hours a day for a few days a week (or even if possible the entire week) would I still be able to get the required 360 hours within 10 weeks? CATEGORY: Cats </message>

<message>QID: YA:20150608021257AA8Ngjy TITLE:  My cat suddenly won't lie down on my bed? BODY: For the last two or three weeks, my three and a half year old cat suddenly stopped coming onto my bed at night, preferring to sleep under it or on the couch I have at the end. He has still been sleeping happily on my mom's bed and will cuddle with her. Also one night I had to sleep on the couch in my living room because a guest was using my room, and he lied down next to me for a bit. Also he still jumps up onto my bed in the mornings when I'm waking up. It is freaking me out and making me really sad because he's been sleeping next to me ever since I got him when he was 7 weeks old. Any help is greatly appreciated, as I'm freaked out and can't find any good answers that reassure me. Could this be because I relocated a monitor out of my room around that time?  Thanks, Griffin  Note: I've tried bringing him onto the bed, and petting him and talking to him soothingly, and as soon as I lower my guard he runs. CATEGORY: Cats </message>

<message>QID: YA:20150608042229AAlSzso TITLE:  Is my dentist responsible? BODY: So, I had two cavities filled two Wednesdays ago. Right after; I was experiencing pain and tenderness when I drank hot or cold liquids. I called my dentist that following Monday and he got me in right away. He said my filling was to high so he shaved it down (btw that hurt!). Then the pain increased by a lot and got real sharp pains when I would drink anything cold or hot. So, I called again on this past Wednesday. He got me in right away again and said one of my fillings had a crack in it and he joked that I must have done something to it because it was a great looking filling. My dentist then put a medicated filling in and said if this doesnt work he's going to have to extract my tooth.  At first it felt fine. It was sore but, I didnt have any horrible pain. When the third day hit the pain came back full force and its more painful than before. It doesnt hurt when I drink anything tho but, when I touch my gums there is a sharp pain.  I worried to call him today because he's going to want to take my tooth. I'm getting married in two month and I  prefer not to look like a hillbilly.  Im not looking to sue my dentist by any means but, I want to know if my dentist would be responsible if he has to take my tooth. I didn't have any issues until he filled my cavities. Heck, I would rather have my tooth decay and have more time with it then go thru this. CATEGORY: Dental </message>

I was considering using makeup to make some extra cash.

W/O the keratin treatment I got this past week my hair grows looking like a curly mullet 'fro. It's horrible, horrendous, and I wish I naturally had straight hair.  Anyways, ~2yrs ago or so I started growing out my hair in the hopes of having what is "flippy" hair or "scene" hair one day. I knew I would have to go to a salon and get it done because I had NO experience doing my own ratchet-a** hair and get it chemically treated because it would be impossible to do it with my natural hair.  Last Sat I finally was able to get flippy hair I've wanted. My stylist gave me the treatment, choppy layers, and a slight left-parted fringe.  My ?s to you guys though is how do I make it a little more crazier and maintain a "scene" look at home? I couldn't make it crazier because of the 3 day no-wash period and now my left arm is injured for a while.  My bottom layer goes down to my shoulders &amp; a bit past it on the back. When I wash my hair it does still get kinda curly &amp; poofy, but nowhere near the extent it did before the keratin.

Is it to fuel my self esteem and my confidence ? Do I feel that all alone I have little worth? Instead of heaven am I trying to build treasures on earth? Do I want to impress others, show them that im cool? A kind of 'look what I have here', as vain as a fool. Could it be momentary pleasures I  feel led to chase? Sinning in the sight of the Lord, before him a disgrace. Or am I looking for something I have yet to obtain? A deep and meaningful bond that the world couldn't change. It seems to me that it only exists in fairytales. Maybe I'm wrong but its the truth as far as I can tell. I haven't finished living yet but Ive been here a while.

<message>QID: YA:20150608073134AAFXptv TITLE:  Spooky Skittish Rescue Horse?!? BODY: Last year I bought an rescue horse who had previously been starved and abused. So,  for the time I spent with him,  I got him to a good spot. I could go up to him,  he'd come to me. He would listen,  I could saddle him up,  touch all legs,  etc. He was becoming a good horse.  Then some things happened and I couldn't see him for a couple month. He and my other horse were left with my mother. She let them push her around. Now I've came back and he won't let me touch anywhere accept his face and neck.  If I try to get him on a lead rope,  he runs away.  He's making my two other horses act crazy. Both of which I am training. (I have trained horses before.) I will do everything in my power to help the rescue. (I'm 14 years old). My mother won't let me give him away to someone that could help him,  and train him. So, what are some ways to earn his trust,  respect,  and make him trust humans again? I really don't wanna give up on him. Please no rude answers,  if you think I should give him to someone with more time and experience. Just say it but don't be mean.  I've dealt with similar horses,  but I wasn't training two others.  Thanks! CATEGORY: Horses </message>

It has recently come to my attention that Germany doesn't charge for tuition. I know for certain that undergrad is free, but is this true for dental school as well? Also, I've heard that a German trained dentist will need to complete additional years in the US if they want to practice in the US. However, I am still considering the idea of going. A few questions:  1. Is tuition for dental schools also free? How much would it cost per semester? 2. Can a German trained dentist practice in other countries (other than US) with no difficulties? 3. What is the difference in training between a US and German dental school? (One German University made it sound as if it were more practice and less lecture, true?) 4.

<message>QID: YA:20150608082240AAJOROD TITLE:  Problem in Compaq Monitor. **no input signal***? BODY: When I turn on the computer and the monitor, the monitor does not recognize a signal from the computer.  I have tried restarting the monitor and the computer, unplugging all cables including the power cables and reconnecting, I re-seated the graphics card, I tried using the VGA cable, but the monitor still seemed to be trying to recognize a DVI connection, even though the VGA cable was plugged in.  Right after I turn on the monitor it says:  VGA input, no input signal &gt; DVI input, no input signal recommended setting, 1680x1050  After about 2 seconds it goes to sleep and that is it.  No mouse clicks or keyboard strikes bring the monitor back.  I know of no way to change any settings, reinstall drivers, etc. , because I cannot get the monitor to work, so I am effectively blind, whenever I want to test something out I have to manually shut down the computer and turn it on again.  I encountered this problem in the past, and after much frustration and unplugging/re-connecting, the problem seemed to magically solve itself, but now it is back and nothing seems to work.  The frustrating part is that it seems random, this started happening a few days ago when I tried turning on my computer. My monitor model is Compaq Q2009 CATEGORY: Monitors </message>

Cause when a harlot leaves my bed, I feel empty and dead. My friends tell me its in my head but I mean what I said. Her breasts are perky, her butt is round and stomach flat. Yet when she leaves I dont miss  her or hope shes coming back. I feel dirty for being blinded by her outer shell. And when I trot her path I feel like its the road to hell. I've even smelled the flames while she hollered and yelled my name. The bible warned me or am I just imagining things? Though love never appears ny soul has yearned for it for years.

I have two other cats that already live with me so I'm keeping her in a separate bedroom. I know to keep them separated so that they don't fight until they get used to each other. My cats don't seem to mind her and want to get to know her but she doesn't seem to be liking the idea of meeting them right now and I know it will take some time. My cats are calm around her and want to walk up to her to see whats up but, she'll start hissing and growling at them and then they'll hiss but nobody is fluffing themselves out to appear bigger. The history with this cat is that she was rescued from a shelter that had taken her in from a hoarder so she's been around other cats before but it's been awhile. I know it'll take some time but, if anybody has had a similar situation and could throw some tips my way and what worked best for them.  I'm currently keeping them separated and I'm only introducing them one at a time so she doesn't feel ganged up on and I'm keeping my cats on a leash. Any tips would be appreciated.

<message>QID: YA:20150608151910AAnlpPx TITLE:  Do white people have knowledge of diverse hair textures of black people? BODY: So, I work at a CPA firm and I usually go to the salon to get my hair flat-ironed twice a month. Sometimes I go about 4 months at a time with no heat.  So, I've been really tired lately for these past few weeks and I decided to wear my hair completely natural because I didn't want to go to the salon. I never had a relaxer and my hair is pretty healthy. The job I have is new and so they have never seen my hair in its curly state. My hair is very curly and has very defined curls. Almost the entire firm was asking me is my hair really that curly ( I am 1 out of only 2 black people at a firm of 77 people). I told them that all I did was put water on my hair and let it air dry that same morning. My husband (who is also black) has very silly, wavy hair and he gets the same reaction from people. My reasoning is because my hair isn't the coarse afro texture that they didn't believe it was my hair. I just want to know what you think. Thanks! CATEGORY: Hair </message>

<message>QID: YA:20150608165613AAYWaHI TITLE:  Coarse, thick,poofy,and stiff hair? BODY: I dont use heat very often. The most often i use straightners and blow dryers is 3 times a month. And the blow dryer would be on cool mode.  I use garnier triple nutrition. Ive used it for half a year and it doesnt do anything the reviews say. It doesnt make my hair finer.  My hair is really dry, poofy, and frizzy especially after i wash it. My hair is either too dry and crunchy or too oily.  I wouldnt say my hair is rough. Its just really stiff and sometimes prickly. It goes to my shoulders. And when i compare a single hair to my friends' hair, they all have fine hair than i do. My hair is mostly smooth and straight, some bends and waves from ponytail marks.  What shampoos and conditioners would you recommend to me? No chemical relaxers or anything because my mom wouldnt allow it. CATEGORY: Hair </message>

<message>QID: YA:20150608170810AAhjFTx TITLE:  A painful bump at the back of my mouth. What could this be? Should I be worried? And what can I do to stop this? BODY: So today, I suddenly got a painful sensation in my mouth. I don't have any dental problems now. No toothaches, no problems. But I do have an appointment in September. I admit, I chew gum A LOT. And by a lot, I mean up to 10 mint gums a day due to nervousness. And I like to clench and grind my teeth. So when I went out today, I leaned on my hand and suddenly felt pain on my cheek. I tried to see if it's my tooth by eathing, chewing, touching, putting pressure on and it wasn't the tooth since I don't have any toothaches. I brush my teeth daily and I use mouthwash too. I don't have any visible cavities or problems. So then, I tried to search around with my tongue inside my mouth and felt a light bump at the very top of my upper lip. I can't explain it. When I smile widely, it slightly hurts. It's on the left side and on the inner side of the corner of my cheek. In the corner where the cheeks meet. Almost close to wisdom teeth. And the bump is at the very top. Even if I lift my upper lip up, I can't see that high. It's painful if I touch it or press on it from outside. Otherwise, my gums aren't inflamed and I asked three people to check on it. Nobody saw anyting only my dad said it looks like I ate something sharp and it swelled. I'm really scared it might be abscess but I can't go to the dentist sooner. I don't wanna have tooth problems now because I am travelling soon. What could this be? Should I be worried? And what can I do to stop this? CATEGORY: Dental </message>

They are both 4 and a half years old. They are usually always best friends; they often sleep together and clean each other. But today, one of them (Kahlua) has been very hostile towards the other (Kabuki). It all started when I let them outside for a little while in our backyard to explore while I was out there reading. I don't know what happened, but the anger started after that. Since then, Kahlua jumped on my bed and I was petting her when all of a sudden she saw Kabuki. She started hissing and left the room. Then, just now as I returned home, I went to my room to put something away, and Kabuki was sitting on my jacket. Kahlua followed me into my room but right as she went inside and saw Kabuki, she immediately starting hissing and left the room.  Please help me! They are normally best friends.

I know how to do hair on the side, and although I mainly do hair for adults I was thinking of doing something for kids for this upcoming school year, to do little girls' hair for the beginning of school, whose parents can't afford it. Like ages 5to17, or kindergarten to 12th grade. The styles would be box braids &amp; twists, these styles generally cost 70-100 dollars where im from, but I'd be doing it for free cause I figured it'd be cool to help these little girls in need.

It goes down to the small of my back and I wanted extensions. Yes, my hair is long already, but I wanted to get extensions that are a bit longer. I am getting an inch of split ends cut off. So, think platinum blonde hair. What colors would be good for it? I wanted to get colored ones, so please leave good colors for it. Ombre colors, solid colors, anything really. Also, can someone tell me how easy real extensions re to care for? Or should I get clip ins? I have hair that needs washing every 2 days so, which would be better for a schedule as such?

<message>QID: YA:20150609001014AA2mJyj TITLE:  Temporary dye over blonde highlights? BODY: My hairstylist dyed my blonde hair (via heavy highlights) very dark brown, which I did not like, and then stopped doing hair. I hated it so I let my friend bleach my hair and she fried it. I ended up with lowlights, obviously. But I'm not letting her bleach it again and I can't afford a salon at the moment.  I have no idea what I want to do with my hair but I am so tired of it. I change my hair color very often so going permanently dark seems stupid, although I do want the moisture back in my hair. I don't think I care what color it is as long as it's different and not unflattering. Auburn red is an example of unflattering on me. My question... Should I use a warm Demi permanent color? Like a red-based brown? I know if I use a cool tone it might turn green, which I'm not even sure if I'm opposed to. That's how tired of it I am. Can anyone give me some advice on a good temporary change? I don't want to wing it and make a change that is hard to repair to a tolerable color if it doesn't come out right.

BODY: My kitten/cat who was rescued from a feral cat got pregnant and I had to have her spayed. The vet said she would have had her kittens in less than a week. A feral cat, who looked to have been pregnant, was hit by a car, and I found 4 kittens 7-10 days later. Mouse (my female) took to the kittens within hours and when they would cry when I tried to bottle feed them she would go crazy and cry and try to take the kittens from me. I put the kittens in a box and she immediately jumped in n they latched on to her nipples. I have continued to try to bottle feed them but they just won't eat! For being so little they sure can screw their mouth shut!! Am I hurting Mouse, either mentally or physically? And are the kittens actually eating? Their little belly's went from concave to rounded but it seems they are latched to her a lot. She never complains tho...since bringing the kittens in, 2 of the smaller/weaker ones have passed away. I don't know what to do (the SPCA has no room for them at the shelter nor do they have foster homes for them. I don't mean to sound cold when I say Mouse's mental and physical health are, and always will be, my maim concern. But I want to give these babies a fighting chance!

I know it says not to rebleach bleached hair on the box, but could I do it just a little to get them to match? My thinking was it can't damage the hair that much since I didn't put all the colour I needed on and my hair isn't that damaged in the first place. I don't regularly use curlers/straighteners (in fact I'm pretty sure it's been at least a year), the only thing I regularly use is a hair dryer and I've never bleached my hair before, I've only coloured it about three times in the past two years.

My tooth hurts for almost a week now and I am taking pills against the pain all time. It is not so great pain,I just don't like it.  So I went to dentist about 4-5 ,months ago,5 times for same tooth,but it only hurted for first 3 times. Of course,she gave me anesthetic,and I didn't feel so much pain,only in one or 2 moments it hurted. (As i recall) I now need to go for different teeth,but I am a little bit afraid. I am man,almost 19 years old,but I have fear from dentist. I go to private dentist. Anybody have experience?  Will I feel any pain what so ever even with anesthetic? Thank you!

<message>QID: YA:20150609034032AAnN6mY TITLE:  Question about body hair removal &amp; bleaching and laser hair removal? BODY: I am a 17 year old female, pale with very dark brown hair. I am fairly hairy, not extremely thick hair, but lots of noticeable body hair. I have hair on my legs which I shave with no problems. Also have always had very hairy arms which I also shave without any problems, but I don't shave very often though because I never go in public without a long sleeve shirt on. I also have always had a really hairy lower back and short, fine, but dark hairs at least 5mm long all over my stomach and rest of my back, including the upper back. From a short distance it isn't very visible, but Incan definitely notice it and feel it. It bothers me because my boyfriend tries to touch my back in bed but I don't want him to feel the hair. So I shaved my lower back, it just feels prickly now, not smooth. And it doesn't look good because I have red bumps and tiny pimples all over my lower back.  I was wondering how to fix that problem with my lower back? Also, if I used facial hair bleach all over my stomach, do you think it would help? And if I bleached the hair, then a few months after that got laser hair removal, or purchased an at home laser hair removal tool... like AFTER I had bleached it, and say the hair was blonde now, would the laser hair removal work? Is it the hairs that need to be visible for it to work? Or does it just have to be dark in your genetics? Like do certain chemicals in dark hair make laser work? Or does changing the colour matter, even when it doesn't effect the roots? :):( CATEGORY: Hair </message>

No straighteners, no blow dryers. -I wash my hair with cool to warm water, never hot. -I only use sulfate free shampoo. -I do hot oil treatments and deep condition regularly.  I remember seeing white dots prominently when looking through a mirror (which is not the case now) a few months ago, maybe in march.

Even America is a black country and the moon landing that was totally a black achievement. Einstein, Isaac Newton, and every other scientist in history was black. Jesus, Mohammad, Buddha, were Blacks as well, so all religions are black and since these were Black this means God was black too. The same with Adam and Eve.

But, a few days ago I got hit in the jaw by a soccer ball and now my jaw hurts to open and close. I don't know if I should be using ice to help it or a warm towel? CATEGORY: Dental </message>

<message>QID: YA:20150609085219AApYgMx TITLE:  Why is it a nightmare to find a solution to hair loss? Is there no universal truth to at least preventing hair loss? BODY: I feel like I'm just going to lose more hair by having to read up obviously fake products with obviously fake reviews. More seriously, I am in my mid twenties and I don't have a particularly alarming case, but I can already see a MBP. Thus, I started looking online to find a simple solution I could probably take every day as a supplement or whatnot, but what I found was a wretched mess of fake sh*t and misinformation, terrible side effects and products doing the opposite of what is intended. What is the one true solution to this, WITHOUT killing my sex drive?  The least I want, if anything, is to prevent my hair from losing any more ground. Most of the "hairline renewal" pics just prove there isn't much to gain anyhow. CATEGORY: Hair </message>
