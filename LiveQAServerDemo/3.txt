TITLE:  Is Compton Really A Bad Place?
BODY: I watched the new Straight Out of Compton trailer and have seen some videos of thugs that talk in front of the camera in Compton and I don t understand all these rap songs that say they came from nothing and how bad their life is. Compton to me is actually really nice, they have palm trees, good sized houses and apartments, and nice sunny weather. They also have Los Angelas and Beverly Hills within reach so how can you complain when one of the best opportunities is right next door? For example I came from a country named Latvia and it was a really small place and it looked very broken down and sovietish. When I moved to Washington State with my family my dad and mom had only like $100 in their pocket. I went to some crappy *** apartments in my time and even where I live isn t the best. But my mom makes really good money and we are living fine. So how can us Foreigners who barely spoke english make it when these thugs keep complaining how bad their environment is?

TITLE:  Are there famous and or respectable actors who had a late start?
BODY: I've noticed a lot of actors started as children or preteens. I was wondering have any famous or respectable actors started acting in there late 20s or 30s and gained recognition after? I don't think I'll be able to fully commit to acting until I have a career to finance it; I just want to know that it won't be too late and the possibility of acting on television or film is an actual possibility. Thanks!

TITLE:  Honda Civic 2006 Ex rear seat removal?
BODY: I have a 2006 Honda civic ex and I have a problem that just leads to another. Hopefully I can get some answers. My poblem is that i need to replace the rear struts on my car but in order to do so i need to open the trunk to get to the bolts, the thing is that my trunk wont open. I want to know how can i fold the seats down from inside the car so i can open the trunk? When i push the button on the key to open the car all i hear is a clicking sound but nothing happens. the trunk door does not have a key cylinder and the lever on the driver side wont help eaither so my only solution would be to fold the seats down or unscrew some bolts to take the seats off BUT from inside the car. I managed to get the bottom part (what you sit on) off pretty easy i just have to take off the part where you lean on (where you put your back against) There are so many bolts that i dont know which ones are for what so i dont want to unscrew something that i dont have to. My last option would be to take the car to the Honda dealership which i really dont want to do because they told me they would probably have to break something in order to get to the trunk so that would cost me a lot of money. I really hope i can find an easy way so i can replace my very worn out struts. Thank you

TITLE:  UTI and clit pain??? PLEASE HELP?
BODY: Okay, so I recently took antibiotics for a UTI. But I only took it for 5 days and I had the UTI for almost 2 months and it got really bad, to the point I even had vulvar burning. But I don't think it fully healed?? Because whenever I have to pee my clitoris hurts (I know it's my clit &amp; not my urethra bc my urethra is closer to my vagina, not my clit) and I still have slight vulvar burning. AZO: UTI pills help with the burning during urination, for the most part. And I still have cloudy urine. But the cloudy urine is on and off??? Sometimes it's cloudy and sometimes it's not. Does this sound like a UTI still? Or something else?

TITLE:  Help please??? No one has answered me after ages and I'm desperate.. 10 pts to best answer - birth control?
BODY: So I went on the pill.. Because I had terrible period pain, and I was sorta starting to get these tiny tiny pimples on my jaw line and it was all clumped up and just really gross.. I also had it on my back.. BUT I don't think I had acne, it may have been hormonal or the changes in season.. Or even my new hair wash.. But I went on it and found something out about argan oil and how it helps, I saw significant differences straight away.. I also kept up using cetaphil, it is gentle but super good. However I was on the pill, I sort of want to go off it, been on it for 6 months now, and I'm 17 almost 18.. I have clear skin and I'm so grateful and I'm really happy! I also eat a lot better because I thought it may help. However I'm worried if the effects was just because of the pill and not the regime I have going. If I go off it, will all those tiny pimples on my jaw and chin start coming back? I'm really scared but I do kind of want to off it
