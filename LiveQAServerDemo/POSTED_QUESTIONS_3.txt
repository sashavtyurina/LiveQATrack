TITLE:  I can't slow down my horse!!!?
BODY: I have an 11y/o Anglo Arab, and whenever I ask for the canter she gallops (I think it's because she's unbalanced) .... I can't slow her down to a nice canter...... Most of the time I'll just let her gallop for a while until she tires herself out a little because I don't want to ask her to go slower and her ignore me (don't want to form bad habits). After she get a little tired I'll let her walk then I'll ask for the canter again, I'm usually able to get her to do a fast canter now. I can't slow her down enough to circle her safely, and shes too uncoordinated to do canter polls.  So I guess what I'm asking is 1) is the gallop to tire out method creating bad habit or is that okay? And 2) what's another method to get her to slow Down 3) how can I get my horse and I more balanced at the canter?   Thanks!!!!!!!

BODY: Why do people root for someone just because they share a nationality? I don't get, I don't see how sharing nationality is any different from sharing handedness or a favourite colour. I've always rooted for people I find likable, regardless of their nationality, and frankly I find Murray to be rather unlikely indeed,  he was actually pro Scottish indolence! So why do the English root for him when he is only loyal to Scotland?

BODY: Not sure where this is going
But I like you so much
The uncertainty of not knowing
Yet I'm missing your touch

There are times when I ponder
If you are probably the one
Other times in reality I wonder
What I did to make you run

One more chance with you to talk
Settle this mess we made
Before you decide to forever walk
Hoping my feelings will fade

It's blatantly obvious they are not
I hesitate to say I love you
With my heart and mind I fought
Knowing what I feel is true

As for you, a great man, my lover, my friend
Without a doubt you know how exactly how I feel
You are the only man for me in the end

BODY: I have a 8 year old spayed female cat. Remeber she's SPAYED. She lives in our garage with her brother. They go outside from time to time to enjoy the heat. We live on 18+ acres and the rest is dense forest. Before my aunt moved in and brought her monster sized dogs, Missy (her name) would leave and stay gone for 3-4 weeks at the most. She'd always return and stay for 3-4 weeks. Fatten up and then leave again. This went on for a least 2 to 3 years. Where did she go?

TITLE:  What is your opinion about the Confederate flag?
BODY: All because of ONE man’s actions everyone is up in arms over the confederate flag. Its getting ridiculous. The flag is not racist. It is a symbol of patriots who were willing to die to protect this country. Slavery was never the reason for the war but only an excuse to start one. Also, blacks were the first to slave their own people then sell them to the whites. You don’t hear about that in the history books.

I then used cotton buds and applied pressure to the tonsil and more white fluid came out. It's abit sore now but I did use a salt water gargle after to help clean the area. Is it normal for it to hurt/ache afterwards? How can I further prevent tonsil stones from forming again?

TITLE:  Dreadlock locations for white males in baltimore?
BODY: So I'm a white male with fairly long hair. I really want to get dreadlocks but I don't have the knowledge on how to do them plus I'm lazy. So I'd rather have someone start them for me. Does anyone know where a salon or anything that a white guy can get dreads at in Baltimore. The reason I'm emphasizing white is because white and black hair is different and from what I've been told there are different processes in doing dreads. Any help? Thanks. Also no negative comments because I'm going to get them regardless of what you say. 😊

Everything else is perfectly filled in except the goatee part. It sucks because I actually want to see how I would look with a goatee but I can't do that. I've looked in the mirror a couple times and noticed very little baby hairs by the goatee part but I want these hairs to grow in more. Is there any way to help it grow out? Or do I have to wait until I get a little older?

TITLE:  What kind of gel/wax/whatever would I use to keep my hair back?
BODY: I attached a picture of what I essentially want it to look like. (Thats TJ Oshie).

The problem is that I have extremely thick  straight hair. I know once I start "training" it, ill have to get it thinned out.

Lately I've just been getting it soaking wet and then putting on a tight hat and letting it sit for about an hour or two. After that My hair all seems to be pushed back and looks kinda natural. But it doesnt hold for more then 4-5 hours unless I wear a hat on and off all day.

So is there any kind of product I can use to help hold it back. 
I want as natural as possible. I don't want greasy .shiney, wet. But I know its hard to get all of that with one product. 


My friends mom is a profession hairstylist and she essentially told me that because my hair is so thick and not long enough, ill have to use gel to get any kind of look I want.

I just want some other opinions/thoughts.

TITLE:  New ball python owner?
BODY: I just got my new ball python today. She's probably about 2ft and I got her from petsmart. They told me she was eating two small mice pinkies and that she could move up to a fuzzy. We're  having some financial problems so her tank doesn't have very much in it and is 18 gallons (we're going to move it up when she gets bigger). She has a heating mat and one of those red lamps. When I brought her home we fed her the fuzzy which she ate in like 2 minutes. She has no lumps in her stomach at all and we put her in her tank afterwards. She was very active after we put her back but I thought this was normal because it was new to her.
Does she need to move up on the size of mouse or should I try and move her to rats? Is it normal for her to be active?

TITLE:  MY CAT ATTACKED ME FOR THE FIRST TIME!?
BODY: The cat I've had for 10 years now just attacked me. The same one, would follow me to my room at night, because she knew I was going to bed, &amp; when its bed time its cuddle time. Basically what I'm trying to say she loves me dearly, &amp; has never ever thought about hurting me before. In the past couple of months she's been acting different then she has been. For example one minute she will rub on me, lick my face, &amp; head butt me a little bit, but the next minute she's hissing , &amp; swipping at me. Its kinda like a switch goes off. Another one is in the middle of the night maybe 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning she will hysterically meow, &amp; just will do it for hours, &amp; during this time she wont even let me touch her, if I go to put my hand near her she will wig out swipping. But this is the first time she acutely attacked me. My other cat (That I rescued outside almost a year ago) &amp; the 10 year old got into a fight, so I went to brake it up, so I grabbed the 10year old one &amp; was holding her. We made eye contact then she just latched onto my arm, &amp; wouldn't let go with her sharp nails &amp; teeth. After that I sat down on my bed holding my bleeding arm just balling my eyes out. Not because it hurt, because my baby just did that. I had this cat since she was a kitten, so I know she just does not like me. &amp; it cant be the other cat that's making her act like this, because before all this started happening a couple months ago, they would cuddle &amp; groom each other all the time.

One example being someone learning about a relatives passing, moments after it happening, on the page, with everyone else able to see the post. There are more examples, but I would just like to explain that to a staff member when reporting.

TITLE:  What is wrong with my cat?
BODY: She is 16 years old and is being extremely picky with her food.  Usually she just leaves it, then I try her with something else.  I've had a sort of success with the senior cats pouches of food.  However with these she just licks all the jelly off, but as for the meat, that all gets left too.  I don't think she's eating the food of other cats in the neighbourhood as she's usually asleep at my house where I can see her.  She sleeps a lot &amp; is not energetic, which may be down to her age, but her diet (or lack of it) may be contributing to her energy loss.  So why is she leaving all the meat (or dry food) that I give her?  Why is she only eating the jelly?  Is she suffering major internal organ failure that stops her digesting meat?  If you are familiar with this problem is there anything else I can try?  Thankyou.

He doesn't really pull at the walk and trot, but the minute I ask him to canter, he starts pulling his head down and pulling my hands. Honestly, it hurts when he does this, and I don't know what he's going to do with his head when I start jumping him. Can anyone help??

TITLE:  Tips on how to train an excitable young dog to be gentle/calm with new kitten?
BODY: We recently found a 6 week old kitten and decided to keep it. After a quarantine period to make sure the kitten wasn't sick we started to let the dog and kitten out together with a baby gate for safety so the kitten can hide. 

The dog is extremely interested in the kitten and wants to play but she's getting too excited and rough (like pawing at the kitty not biting him) so we're worried the kitten will get hurt. The kitten doesnt' seem to mind, he hisses sometimes if the dog comes up to him too fast but he likes to chase after her and smack at her in play.

Looking for tips on how to train the dog to be calm around the kitten and play gently so she doesn't hurt the kitten. Anyone have advice? We do have an adult cat that the dog chases sometimes so she knows what cats are, but she's way more excited about the kitten than she has ever been about the cat.

Thanks in advance!

TITLE:  1st premolar extractions with braces on?
BODY: Ok so my top 1st premolars never grew in, but they did on the bottom. According to my orthodontist, that's what I have severe crowding on my bottom front teeth, (because its not even). 

The orthodontist wants to put the braces on first, and then extract the two bottom 1st premolars. 

1) Should I ask about a palate expander? (I'm 15) 

2) Will removing the 1st premolars affect my appearance? How? 

3) Since I have the braces on, what type of things will they put, if any, to close the gap? (Closing loops, power chains, etc.) 

4) Appx how long would it take for the gap to heal and the teeth to start moving in so its not as noticeable? 

Sorry for so many questions, Im really confused and worried about the entire process

BODY: Every time I play basketball or some sports that has to do with a lot of running back and forth; my toes or more specifically the skin under my nails turn dark. I thinks its from the pressure of me pressing my feet against the ground while hooping. How do I fix this? this happened before and my toe heal but it took a long time. Is there something that can make my nails stronger or more healthy or something. I play basketball a lot and its summer so I'll be at the pools too. So its something I want to be taken care of.

TITLE:  What will my dentist do?
BODY: Hello! So in October I was told I was going to be getting a loose molar soon, well awhile ago it broke loose, but it isn't really loose at all, it just wiggles back and forth the slightest bit. I am terrified of dentists, but this one has really helped because I had no dentist from middle school to 10th grade due to lack of insurance. But I have a cleaning this week and I wanna know if the dentist would try pulling it, the tooth doesn't give me any pain at all, but it has a cavity in it. So will he try pulling it, fill the cavity or leave it alone? Cant something with the cavity in a loose tooth spread? Rotting the other teeth? Or am I confused. I just wanna know if he would pull it or fill it, because when he fills my cavities he literally takes about all the middle of the tooth, leaving a little bit of the sides to keep in my mouth and fills it, instead of just drilling enough to remove the cavity. If he fills it, wouldn't it leave him to just pulling it right there? Again, terrified of dentists and hate talking about my mouth and hate dentistry.

TITLE:  Turtle care?
BODY: My sister in law is visiting with my 2 nephews, one is 5 the other 3. She bought some red eared sliders at the flea market that are still very small and came in a transport tank about the size of those bug catcher toys. They're staying with us for at least another week and won't buy a bigger tank because they have one at home (they're from Iowa, we live in South Carolina) I'm worried about the turtles health because they don't have heat lamps or an actual tank, plus the kids are handling them a lot (the turtles are very friendly) they want to keep them in a long bowl that's shallow but deep enough for them to swim out on our patio since it's warmer out there. They bought food and washed off some smooth edged sea shell for them to sit on. We checked for edges so they won't cut their feet. Is there anything else we can do? We can't force them to get the stuff and can't buy it for them ourselves. I'd just really hate for my nephews visit to be ruined over their new pets dying and it'd just be sad to see the turtles go too. Also can we use filtered water from the sink for them to swim and change it everyday? And will they make it the 2 day car ride back with no heat lamp? Please don't bash my in laws, they made a impulsive , uneducated choice for their kids and I'm just doing what I can to help keep them alive for my nephews. Thanks

It is heartbreaking, I have a kid and it makes me sick to think this is happening to any child. Are the pictures genuine? They are never shown by the media, which is exactly what it says on facebook (i.e this is what the media isn't showing you)

TITLE:  Help, I found a kitten!?
BODY: I will take her to the vet tomorrow so dont worry.

In the meantime I have been wondering this. She is 6 weeks old and has had diarrhea for over 3 days. She seems very thin and not as active as before. In the meantime I have been feeding her Pedialyte. I have also noticed she has worms in her stool. She has not had her deworming shots, could this possibly be the reason as to why shes has had diarrhea?  Shes very thin and somewhat dehydrated. Yet she still jumps and eats fine. She drinks alot of water...thanks

TITLE:  Should I shave my head?
BODY: I'm tired of my damaged hair and the roots are coming in. So would it just be easier to shave my head instead of dyeing it brown and damaging it even more to get it all one color? And would I even look good with a shaved head? Not fully bald, I'd keep some hair there, like in ch (maybe less) but the majority of it would be gone. 

I'm blonde shoulder length, paler skin. My natural color is brown and my roots are clearly visible. I want my hair long but it is so damaged. And I went to the salon the other day and they lady cut my bangs too short so theres that.

The skin all around it is torn. Its 2 days later and I've been using a brace, But it hurts to walk and its bruised. It also hurts to bend my ankle in any way. I'm pretty sure it's not sprained/twisted but is it so bad i should go to the doctor?

TITLE:  My cat jumps on my lap and meows loudly when I try to pet him. He seems as if he can t get comfortable, as he keeps "dancing" around My lap.?
BODY: He is 9 months old and not neutered. He just recently started doing this. Sometimes he will jump on me and let me pet him like normal, but sometimes he freaks out like this. It is SO ANNOYING. He will tap his back feet around on my legs like he is trying to find a spot to lay. Sometimes, if I leave him be and let him do this, he will eventually lay down on me and stay there. However, and slight motion with my hands causes him to shriek and sit up. If I let him, he meows loudly, and jumps off, only to jump right back on and keep on being annoying. Some days are better than others. What is happening? I almost can t stand it anymore. Someone please help, I ve tried everything: playing with him, letting him be, giving him treats, feeding him. Maybe he is just lonely? I don t know. It s at random times, and I m starting to freak out about it. It s driving me nuts.

TITLE:  My baby betta fish i got from petco isn't growing?
BODY: About 10 months ago I got a baby betta fish from petco. It is completely healthy and it has started turning bluish and red, but it hasn't grown really. I've had it for basically a year, and I switched it from a 2.5 gallon tank to a 5 gallon tank just recently, but it still doesn't grow. I was planning on getting him a bigger tank once he grew bigger. He's/she's completely healthy, and his tank is clean. I feed him brine shrimp and flakes that "bring out betta fish's color." he has natural plants in his water and pebbles and a house to sleep and hide in. Why is he not growing? :(

BODY: Ever since I was born I've had thin, straight hair, but in the last year or so I have gotten these pieces around my face that are about 2 inches and curly/really wavy, while the rest of my hair is long and straight. The last time I was at a salon they blamed it on wearing bobby pins but I don't see how that would make them curl like they do. What could be the cause of it? And how could I fix it without straightening it and damaging my hair?

TITLE:  Adult canine grown over baby canine?
BODY: I'm 14, I have lost nearly all of my baby teeth by now (I had a slower process than most for some reason) but one of my baby canines is still there. The adult canine has been growing in on top of it, and I'm really scared I've waited too long to get the baby one pulled because the adult is pretty much already grown in above the other tooth. Am I gonna just have to deal with it up there forever or is there a way for the dentists to push it down somehow or is it too late?

TITLE:  Should I be worried about the stools that my kitten is producing?
BODY: Sorry if this is TMI but I'm genuinely worried about my 7 (almost 8) week old lilac point Himalayan kitten that I got just this week on monday. I can easily feel all of the bones in his body and basically for this whole week he wasn't producing any stools (but he was peeing) just until today. When I went to clean out his litter box, I noticed the stools he produced were black with a mucus like substance on them. He had his first vet appointment about two weeks ago before I got him, and he was wormed and they said he was healthy. The owner that I got him from gave me the exact type and brand of dry food that she was supposedly feeding him and I gave him the dry food and he doesn't even want it at all. I went out and bought him wet canned kitten food which he really likes. I have given him half of the can everyday and he eats it whenever he starts to get hungry. I have also put a cup of the dry food near his wet food but he still isn't interested in it. He also drinks water and is very lively. Should I be really worried? Any feedback on what this could be is helpful. Also, I'm scheduling a vet appointment tomorrow I just want to know what I might be expecting if any of you know. Thanks in advance.

BODY: I hit my knee pretty hard on a corner. The pain was very intense and I had to sit down for awhile. Once the pain hadostly subsided I just stood up and walked but it hurt to bend. I have a very hard time walking up stairs because of the pain. I have a very faint bruise and little to no swelling. The pain isn't unbearable but is not fun at all. It hurts to walk up stairs or just even walk sometimes. What did I do?!?!

TITLE:  How can you find out how someone died?
BODY: We have a friend who died mysteriously and suddenly at age 48 back in 2007.  I can find her birth and death records on numerous sites online but none of them say "how" she died.  She died in NYC/Manhattan.

How can we find out "how" she died, and is this public information?

We think she might have accidentally overdosed on prescription medications, but its just a guess.

TITLE:  Baby hairs appeared on top of my head?
BODY: I have always had soft, long, straight hair, right now it's past my hips. Ive never had baby hairs around my hairline, or anywhere on my head. But lately Ive been noticing these really annoying fine short hairs sticking up along my hair part. And now any way I divide my hair, they stick up.
What could be causing this? What's a long term way to prevent it?

TITLE:  Would it be okay to use Color Oops before going to a salon?
BODY: I've been dying my hair a fairly bright red (Garnier Olia Dark Intense Auburn) since February, and I'm ready for a change. I'm planning on going an ombré in order to help me grow out my naturally light hair and hopefully stop dying it. I have an appointment at a salon Wednesday, but I am considering purchasing a box or two of Color Oops beforehand. I figured that it would be easier to help lift the red for the stylist and also more gentle on my hair than bleaching it multiple times. Would this be a good idea or would it actually make the process more difficult?

TITLE:  My guinea pig quite recently started laying down... is this normal?/?
BODY: Hello... I've got myself a guinea pig like 3 months ago and I'm a little concerned about him cuz I don't know a lot about guinea pigs... the problem is that up until last week I'd put bedding in his cage and i never saw him lie down or anything, he was always on his all fours, but then i changed the bedding with towels and blankets and few hours ago I saw him lie on his side with the food in his bowl not touched at all.... I gave him a few tiny slices of apple and he ate it right away, he eats his hay... then I got him on my chest and started petting him and he lied flat and kept calm - something he usually doesn't do... now he's in his cage, lying on his side with his head on the blanked, breathing quite fast in my opinion and from time to time he changes his position and keeps lying, and also moving when there's some stronger sound around him... when he was out of his cage for a walk he seemed fine, moving around, running... i'm worried, I don't know what to do... :(

TITLE:  How did the Clippers even manage to get by the Spurs?
BODY: Game 1 &amp; 4 the Clippers man handled the Spurs especially Game 4. All season  watched the Clippers vs the Spurs and I said to myself, if any team can beat the Spurs it has to be the Clippers

Then they lost to the Rockets after destroying them in Game 3 and 4.

BQ: If the Clippers closed out the series vs the Rockets how would they have faired against the Warriors? My friend said that if you can beat the Spurs than you can practically beat any team out there.
BQ2: Why did the Clippers even face the Spurs in the first round? If all went well, who would the spurs and clippers actually would have faced if the seedings didn't go by the NBA rules?

TITLE:  Keyboard malfunctions on desktop?
BODY: As I type this on my tablet, I apologize for any errors in this. Im currently at a loss as to what to do here, my asus desktop computer has this built in keyboard that ia refusing to work correctly. It first started off when it would have sticky keys, luke I could be typing out a message and suddenly a key is  stuck  and continued to repeat it self until I restart the computer. An air can would not help one bit, even using it4 under all the keys wouldn t help.

Then it would stop working all together. Changing the batteries did not help, and I currently still have the new ones in. And even then restarting the computer fixed the problem. But then these things became more frequent.  Up until the keyboard just stopped, accompanied with the computer giving me just a black screen and a moveable mouse. By sheer luck, I have been able to do a complete restore twice now. But still the keyboard wont work.

To clarify, the keyboard isnt connected to the computer via usb, it is built in so there is no problem there. And currently I cannot afford to go out and buy a new one, so any advice on this is much appreciated.

TITLE:  Breeding hamsters? Where to start, where to learn?
BODY: I love animals to death, and absolutely love genetics. I've always wanted to have a breeding operation of my own, but wouldn't dare mess with dogs, cats, or horses, which are the only things I really own. I also have two Dairy goats, but they only get to be bred once a year, and then the kids are sold. I have enough room for a small animal operation, however, and plenty of people would be interested in Hamsters.

Our local shelters never get hamsters. We are very close, mostly because I pick up strays often, and they never have any. The pet stores (PetsMart, Pet Supermarket, and our Mall Pet Shop which is owned by a horrendous excuse for a human being) all really don't sell healthy animals. Pet Supermarket is about the best place to get them because they are the only one that gives a "Warranty" of sorts, where if the animal becomes sick or dies they will refund. I don't think of animals as an object, trust me, just saying how they treat them. 

There aren't ANY breeders in our area. The closest is about 200 miles. The rest are out of state. I definitely am going to start small, learn more as I go. Maybe one or two females/males at first. I have had plenty of experience caring for them, and have plenty of room, large pens and things for them. I know they can't be housed together (I plan to breed Longhairs) I just would like to learn about conformation flaws to look for, color genetics, anything a breeder would really need to know to breed them. Thanks! And don't say "Not just anybody can do this" even the pros started somewhere.

TITLE:  Can dye stain hair?
BODY: I have naturally black hair and i bleached it to a pretty light blonde. I dyed my hair with a teal semi permanent hair dye. It has been almost two months and it still has not completely faded. It turned into a really ugly light greenish brown color and just stopped getting lighter. I was wondering if it is just very slowly fading or if it has permanently stained my hair? I wash my hair like three times a week by the way so it's not like i just don't try wash it  out. If it has stained, is there any way to get it out without having to bleach it? Thanks!

I want a pixie cut so badly because I absolutely hate my hair right now but I m afraid that if I get one it will end up being poofy and looking like a mushroom.

TITLE:  Is there a reason people think it's funny when cats get hurt?
BODY: I ask this because Yesterday I came across about 4 videos on YouTube of people stepping on their cats by accident, and the cat cries out in pain. The person who stepped on the cat doesn't give a flying f***. The videos only get like 20 dislikes and like 1,000 likes! The comments are like "HAHAHAH LAUGHED SO HARD I CRIED" Wtf?? I thought the video was disgustingly sad! 

So today, I decided to see if it were the same way with other animals. I was only able to find 1 video of a dog getting stepped on, and it got hundreds of dislikes and NO likes. Same with any other animal.

Why do people think cats getting hurt are funny, but no other animals??? I'd hurt myself before I'd hurt ANY animal, especially my cat!

TITLE:  What could possible be wrong with my left big toe?
BODY: PLEASE READ ALL!!!

my left being toe started rotting and smelling bad i went to the ER they gave me antibiotics i been taking for a week now. The smell is gone and its looking much much better and the pain is tolerable. I dont think its a ingrown toenail could it possible be fungus i have another doc appointment tomorrow.

Symptoms

My toenail was naturally a greyish color before this started happening. The back of my nail where the skin is was swollen, bleeding and leaking pus that smelled bad. Does this sound like a ingrown toenail or something different.

Since i been taking the antibiotics its no longer leaking pus and it doesnt smell bad looks like its starting to heal. What could it possible be any ideas thanks for reading and for your help.

TITLE:  Why am i so bad at cross country but I am good at track?
BODY: Hey everyone, I was just curious why I am awful at cross country but good at track and field? 

I am an u14 boy and I can barely get under 12 and a half minutes for a 3km cross country course!

My PB's on track are:
400m - 55.9
800m - 2:15.3
1500m - 4:39

Clearly my track times are better than my cross country pb, but why is this? I feel great when doing long races on the track yet when I enter cross country I feel awful and sluggish.

Any tips on why this may be and what I can do to improve in cross country would be great! Thanks.

TITLE:  My hair is so thin regardless of what I do to try and take care of it?
BODY: I'm 19 and have always had thick, wavy/straight hair but over the past three years it's gradually been getting thinner and thinner. 

I never use heat and hardly wear it tightly (most often I just clip it). I don't brush excessively or when it's wet, I get regular trims, I eat okay, etc. 
I also do not have either anemia or thyroid problems.
The only thing that I can't control is stress - I'm naturally very prone to stress and worry and I have to say it's gotten pretty bad especially over the past couple of years. 

I was just wondering, what can I do to restore my hair thickness?

Is that even possible or is hair loss permanent? 

Thanks x

TITLE:  Tooth bit fork?
BODY: I just accidental bit a fork with my bottom front tooth. The tooth already had a crack running across top from left to right and a very tiny chip and i dont think I did any chipping from the fork (at least not from what I can tell).  I rubbed my tongue against the top and notice It feels like chafe but it might of always feel like that. What im worried about is if I weakened the tooth or crack from the fork making it more likely to chip off in the future. It stung slightly for 10 minutes and didnt chip so maybe it didnt make any difference but I am worried if I bite with it if its more likely to chip now from it possibly being weakened.

TITLE:  Cat peeing outside the litter box, but sometimes still in the box?
BODY: My cat is male, fixed, and will be 4 years old in October. He s eating Blue Buffalo food, and has been for quite a while. He s technically an indoor cat, but will go on nighttime escapades often, and turn up the next morning.

 We just moved mid June. Every few days since then he has been peeing in random spots throughout the house: behind some plastic bags in the laundry room, behind a shelf in the storage room, on the blanket off my bed, etc. I stopped him from going on the rug in the hallway once.
It s frustrating because he hasn t totally abandoned using box, he ll still use it until it becomes, "full," (a.k.a, 1-3 clumps of whatever)
About six months before we moved, he started to poop outside his box that was in the basement, even though his box had been down there for 2-3 years, and even if it was clean. 

We have considered the fact that he was just scent marking, due to possible pets living in the house previous to us...but when he goes, it s puddles, not a smelly spray. 

Any suggestions? He went to the vet last summer (or the summer before) for something stuck in his eye/infection, and the vet didn t say anything about a UTI.

BODY: 1) SG Lance Stephenson...gone to the L.A. Clippers

2) C Roy Hibbert... gone to the L.A. Lakers

3) PF David West... heading to either  the San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors,or even the  L.A. Cliipers.

Would Paul George be a good fit for the Golden State Warriors if times get too tough and he demands a trade?

Maybe it's jump off the sinking ship known as the Indiana Pacers. A good destination for Paul George would be the Golden State Warriors.

Imagine Paul George and David West on the Golden Stae Warriors roster? SF Andre Iguodala could share minuets w/ Paul George.

The Indina Pacers would receive Center Andrew Bogut, SF Harrison Barnes, PF James Michael McAdoo, and a second round NBA 2016 draft pick.


This would be the line up for the Golden State Warriors.
CENTERS: Daymond Green, Festus Ezeli, Ognjen Kuzmic;
POWER FORWARDS: David West, David Lee,  Marreese Speights;
SMALL FORWARDS: Paul George, Andre Iguodala, Kevon Looney';
SHOOTING GUARDS: Klay Thompson, Justin Holiday, Brandon Rush;
POINT GUARDS: Stephen Curry, Shawn Livingston.

TITLE:  How to deal with unwanted advice/rude people at a boarding facility?
BODY: I recently moved my horse to a partial-board/DIY style of barn. There is an older man there with a paint horse, rides Western. Says he team pens. Actually, I've never seen him ride... He is funny and nice (or tries to be), and he's there all the time. I swear he lives there.

However, he is constantly giving me unwanted advice. These are some of the things he says/does...

-"Where do you get your hay? Oh I wouldn't get it from there. This is where I get it from"

-"Why do you use those kind of shavings? I use this kind. I'd be scared my horse would inhale that with the kind you're using".

-"Your Arabian sure is HOT. You sure you can handle that? Arabians remind me of (insert racist remark about Muslims here). There is an auction around here, easy to sell horses at it. Could find a nice QH or paint there too."

-"School is getting to you huh? I bet if you went 9 weeks without having to do this (he meant riding, caring for my horse, etc) you'd be so relieved. Then you could concentrate on school" 

Lol. And that is very brief. This man holds conversations for SO LONG. Its ANNOYING! And I know he probably means well, but its a little rude too... I don't need advice on hay, I'm not sending my to AUCTION so I can get a QH, I'm not getting out of horses because I'm in college!

Anyway, I don't want to cause trouble or tension since he is there all the time. But this man is going to drive me NUTS. And I am unfortunately too nice to tell him to bugger off. Any advice or ideas?

TITLE:  Should I go to the hospital?
BODY: I've had 5 gold bracelets on my wrist for 5 years now. They weren't tight around my wrist but I couldn't take them out either. Yesterday my dad and I took them out with soap and at some points it would get stuck halfway through my hand but we took them all out and my hand got swollen and red. Today I looked at my hand and it's still swollen and red and kinda very light bruised kinda color and it hurts really bad if I touch it. 

Should I go to the hospital? Or is this not a big deal?

TITLE:  Bumblebee Queen with damaged wings! What should I do?
BODY: I have a Bumblebee Queen with damaged wings in a nest box and I've been caring for her. I believe she got some sap or something sticky on her, one of her little wings is stuck in an upward position and the rest are brittle and stuck together. I tried to help her clean it off but the wings are just too damaged. She's been fine with it though.

However, she just started freaking out a moment ago and getting stuck on her back desperately trying to get up. I try to help her up but she immediately falls back. It's like she suddenly has no balance. I put a cold pack over the nest box to cool her down and she's sedate for the moment.

Is the stuck wing giving her balance problems? What should I do? Clip the wings maybe? I just don't know what would be best for her. I really don't want her to die.

TITLE:  How to Remove AntiAdBlocker?
BODY: Please DO NOT go to Google and throw me a few websites on removal, I have seen them all. They repeat themselves and don't actually address the problem.

- AntiAdBlocker is NOT a browser extension. I cannot simply go to the list of Extensions and remove it.

- AntiAdBlocker is NOT a [normal] program. It is not listed in the Ad/Remove Programs list.

- AntiAdBlocker is working around AdBlock, a powerful Extension that will even circumvent ads on Youtube. (And no, AntiAdBlocker didn't come from AdBlock.)

- When AntiAdBlocker first shows up on any number of regularly visited sites, it locks the browser. Nothing can be done. You cannot exit the browser (Google Chrome), you cannot click on anything, you can't minimize it, you can only click to try and exit. Sometimes after exiting the popup reasserts itself, which means the only way to get rid of it is to force Chrome to close via Task Manager.

- If left alone, AntiAdBlocker even runs a voiced ad, a woman's voice is prompted, "Security alert..." and she then repeatedly warns that infection needs to be removed and to call the phone number on the screen.

- Revo Uninstaller (which worked great for other issues), Avast, AdwCleaner, Malwarebytes, AVG, Spyhunter, Spybot S&amp;D, Avira, Windows Defender, all of these have failed in even detecting the problem.

- Uninstalling Google Chrome and reinstalling does not help.

- Neither did a System Restore

TITLE:  What would happen if I put red dye over my dark brown hair without bleaching it?
BODY: I've been wanting to dye my hair a dark red recently, but I really don't want to bleach my whole hair in fear of killing my curls (as my hair is naturally very curly) and ruining my hair in general. I'd really like to die it, but if I regret the color, I'd rather not have to live as an odd red-blonde while working to grow out my hair, which already grows slowly enough. 

If I were to dye my hair a dark red with temporary dye, what would happen to my hair, if anything? Also, does bleach kill curls?

Thanks!

BODY: I plan on getting a tattoo for my upcoming birthday and am a bit curious about the cost. I plan on getting the phrase "The longer I live, the more beautiful life becomes" tatted on my left shoulder in cursive font. Does anyone have an estimate to how much this will possibly cost? Thanks!

TITLE:  USB Devices Stop Working Randomly?
BODY: Every few days my USB devices connected to my computer stop working. I don't understand why. I am able to fix it by going back to a system restore point on my PC. (Navigating windows with a PS2 keyboard). I am able to access the bios with USB devices just fine, but when I get to the login screen for windows 8, my mouse and keyboard don't work.  The led lights on my mouse are even turned off, like the system doesn't even recognize and send power to the device. Could this be a USB controller problem? I am using an MSI gaming motherboard. Could it be a software issue? I'm pretty much clueless as to what the problem is and how to fix it so it doesn't keep happening. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

BODY: A few months ago I was fooling around on World Of Warcraft private servers on an old laptop. I tried out a few hacking tools and downloaded a malicious one. My computer was being controlled, I ran malware bytes while the hacker was in control of the computer. It came up with a threat I ripped the battery out. I then changed all my passwords online, and reinstalled Windows later on the computer. Is there any other precautions I should take, could this hacker still hack me?

TITLE:  When should I start leasing a horse?
BODY: I started riding a year and almost a half ago and I absolutely love it. At first my plan has always been to start leasing when I turn 16 (I'm turning 16 next year in March) that way I could get a job to pay for it myself, and also drive myself there. But recently I've been thinking that I won't be ready till I'm 17 or maybe even 18. I think it's because I'm just afraid that I won't be ready yet. I think that by 16 I'll have enough knowledge. I already know how to tack up (duh) ride in a posting trot, lope, lead changes, indirect reigning, ect. My trainer has taught me how to do barrels and poles also. I know that I'm still learning. But does anyone think I could be ready to lease by 16, maybe 17?

I know you don't need it, but I want the lip balm to be firm. If I use some of the month EOS, would I be able to smell it in the new lip balm? I planned on adding a bit of vanilla extract, but I'm not sure if it will make it smell worse. Should I use the old EOS, just leave it out, or just use something else, like, make a starburst flavored one?! Thanks! :-)

BODY: It all started a year and a half ago,
I had great long hair; all my natural color. I decided to get highlights put in and ended up hating them, so I bought box dye and "tried" dying back to my natural shade. Well after a while it fades and turns brassy and I continuously dye it. This time I dyed it a color called darkest golden brown and it came out severely blotchy and uneven. I just want my natural color back. What should I do? I don't have money for salon. Should I just chop it all off and let it grow back out?

TITLE:  How to convince parents for pet rats? Read description?
BODY: My sister and I do very well in school, and we were fascinated by rats. I am a high school student, while my sister is just two years younger than me. We have done months of researching and saving up money for starting costs and upkeep. We will be paying for everything, and I will be getting a part-time job. We take excellent care of our two budgies, since we are the only ones who care about them (our parents are not at all interested in them, and my brother doesn't want to, really) We are planning to adopt two male rats from our local shelter. We have planned out everything but still haven't got our parents' permission. 

Our dad is alright with the rats, he doesn't mind as long as we are paying for the rats' care. Our mom, on the other hand, is not okay with rats. She associates them with wild, sewer rats. The last time I asked to just talk about the pets, she said, "Rats are ugly animals, I don't want that in my house!" She claims they smell terribly because her friend's rodent pet (chinchilla) smell.

- What are the pros and cons of owning a rat? 
- What can we do to persuade them? (We are working on a PowerPoint presentation, what should we include?) 
- What is your experience with pet rats? (We will be showing this to our parents.)
- How can I show that domestic rats are different from wild rats? 

I'm so sorry if this was really long, but I'm willing to try :) 

Please don't give any hate, or say stuff like, "their house, their rules." My dad is fine, my mom's not.

TITLE:  Getting my hair cut scene?
BODY: So I'm not going over board or anything, chopping off my hair and dying in pink lol but I want scene fringe, I've  done a lot of research and I know how to style since I have styled my bestfriends scene hair for a long time.

So I have a few questions:

1. When asking for a scene hair cut how should I explain it to the hair stylist?

2: for scene hair must you wash it everyday for the fringe to stay in tact?

3. What are some good shampoo and conditionars and hair sprays?

Any good fringe pictures would be appreciated so i can show it to the hair stylist.

I am aware that scene hair isn't popular today but I love that hair and I don't care what anyone else thinks. It's my hair and I can do what I want.

Btw my hair is long(up to my belly button) and thick, and naturally straight so I won't have to straighten everyday probably only the fringe

TITLE:  My turtle keeps pushing my other turtle off the tank?
BODY: So I have 2 yellow bellied sliders when I first got them they would basking together, now I noticed my turtle Shellybean (don't judge the name) has been pushing my turtle Hyper off the basking dock. It's big enough for both of them. I did notice that one day they were wiggling their claws at each other all around the tank. I am guessing Hyper is a female. They are both still babies though. Hyper is bigger has short nails and a flat plastron. Shelly is smaller, has longer claws, had sort of a concave plastron.

Shellybean just pushes Hyper off, sometimes he just pushed her of using his head, and if that doesn't work he bites Hyper off the basking dock. The weird thing is that Shellybean doesn't even stay on the dock, he just swims away. He hasn't tried to bite Hyper in the water or anything.

Pls I need help. I don't know what to do. Is there anyway that they can stop or is there anything I can do. I don't have space to place two separate tanks. I don't want to give my turtle Shellybean away. I love them both. Pls I need help ASAP

TITLE:  When will my concussion symptoms go away?
BODY: I got a concussion exactly two months ago, and I'm still getting symptoms, mainly headaches. I got it from a whiplash incident in a soccer game, I didn't actually get hit in the head. When do you think my symptoms will subside. I've been to doctor and got a CT scan.  Am I going to have headaches forever? This is no way to live.

TITLE:  What's bottle-necking my PC?
BODY: Built this beast a few years ago:

AMD FX-8150 Zambezi 8-Core 3.6GHz
EVGA GTX 970 (This is ym new GPU, couple months old)
Gigabyte 970A-UD3 Motherboard
8 GB (RAM)
840 EVO SSD (250 GB)(Also new, as explained below)
770W PSU

So for awhile now it's been slow. Upgraded to a 970 and it didn't do a whole lot. But then this week I WIPED my computer completely now I'm using an SSD for games and my OS.  The computer runs amazing now in everything EXCEPT games...  I have to play in low settings (like BF4, Skyrim, The Forest). It's smooth in low settings but if I bump up the graphics at all I get extreme FPS spikes and it's unplayable. 

What's slowing me down from gaming? 

CPU speeds:

Thanks a ton for even reading this. I'm desperate ;-;

TITLE:  Is my bruise getting worse?
BODY: This weekend I went on a homemade water slide and when I went down it I hit my butt on one of the plastic barrels on the side really hard. I was really close to hitting my tail bone. The next day I looked and I had a huge bruise. It was a really dark purple, close to black. It hurts to sit down so I have to sit on my side. It s been three days since it happened and my bruise is bigger and is turning a little red in the middle but now there is more purple bruising around it. It still hurts sitting and when it gets bumped. Do I need to see a doctor or will it heal soon? How long do you think it will take to heal?

TITLE:  My pet rats seem to prefer clinging to me instead of exploring. Should this be worrisome?
BODY: I got a pair of rats from Petco 4 days ago, and I couldn't be happier with the choice! However, everything I read says that they have to gradually get used to their human, and be allowed to freeroam. Well, so far they have warmed up to me really quickly. They don't flinch or run from my hands, and they seem to be eager to get out of their cage for play time. The thing that concerns me is that both girls seem to prefer hanging out on my head/shoulders/body than exploring the area I have set up for them. It is very quiet and warm, with toys and treats. Should I be concerned? Is this a good sign? Please and thank you!

TITLE:  I wanna bring release my pet turtle into this pond?
BODY: So I bought 2 pet turtles at a pet store a few months ago and I can't keep up with cleaning the tank and the tank is pretty big but I don't think the turtles are happy. Whenever I get close to the tank they scratch at the tank as if they want to be set free. So there is the pond close to my house where there are a lot of turtles and they have their own little community there. So would it be a good idea to set them free. I have worries because since they were bought at a pet store I assume that they don't know how to find food or know how to live in the wild because they are used to being fed and living a tank. So is it a good idea to set them free in the pond or give them to someone else where they won't be happy living in a tank.

TITLE:  Is my kittens spay incision infected?
BODY: My 6 month old kitten just got spayed on Wednesday and it is now Sunday. She licked most of the glue off the incision the first day before I could get an E-collar on her, but a little remains at the bottom. It's slightly swollen all around the cut and the bottom end is hard under her skin. She has a slight seepage, you can see the wet fur around the incision. The remaining glue turned a booger green color and her eyes have also been watering. She's forming more eye boogers than normal. Is she okay? Is this just part of the healing process or is it infected?

TITLE:  Problems with cat.?
BODY: Hi. I have a cat who I have been having problems with for a couple weeks now. My cat had kittens around 7 weeks ago. A couple weeks ago one of her kittens died and she has been acting strange ever since. Normally she loves to be around her kittens and play with them. She started loosing weight rapidly 2 weeks after the kitten died. She has lost chunks of hair on her neck and back. She is eating less, but still remains active. A couple days ago she has started attacking her kittens. She's been acting very bipolar. At one moment she will be playing with them then the next attacking them. More so then a mom-cat would when weening a kitten. She growls when anyone but myself tries to pet her, but other times she will rub up against people searching for attention. If anyone knows what is going on, please help!

TITLE:  Get a cat to approach you?
BODY: Recently, my indoor cat (which is a she), got outside. Their are Tom cats outside so that is why keep her inside. We have a screen door which opens and closes by a series of magnets, which we opened to cool the house down. She opened it and got outside. We got her inside, but only because she ran away from us to the inside. I would like for her to approach me so I could pick her up and carry her inside so she does not get away. She usually lets me carry her when she is inside, but when she got out this time she kept running away from me. Any suggestions?

TITLE:  SOLVED Computer shuts down while gaming?
BODY: Specs:
3.2g AMD Phenom 2 X4 840
Hitachi HDS721010CLA SCSI 1000G 
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 550 Ti 
850W PSU

It first started crashing while playing Counter Strike GO and the crashes became frequent. Shortly after it started crashing in LoL aswell. The screen will go white and I can only shut it down manually. 

Ive recently upgraded my tower, adding 3 more fans for a total of 6. I put the new rig together only to have the same problem. I dusted everything and added afterburner to increase my GPU fan speed. My PSU is very hot after the shut downs in the new Tower. 

What could be causing this? Very limited knowledge in this subject so any info/advice would be great. Thanks

Let me know if I left out any info

TITLE:  My computer boots up but I have no signal?
BODY: Whenever I turn my computer on it will boot up, but the display shows that it has no signal.
The strange thing is, when I don't have either of my r9 290x's seated in the PCIE lanes, my computer will display the signal to my monitor just fine. But when the gpu's are in the lanes and powered, even though the hdmi cable is connected to my motherboard, it won't display a signal.

Both gpu's have their fans spin up upon booting, but I don't know of another way to tell if they are working correctly.
I have tried reseating the gpu's in different lanes but it doesn't work.
The debug LED on my motherboard shows no problems when booting up whether the gpu's are seated on the motherboard or not.
So everything seems to work fine except for the gpu's.
Is there a way I can fix this?

My monitor is a BenQ RL2455
Motherboard is an MSI Z97 Gaming 5
Cpu is Intel 4690k
Both GPU's are R9 290x from Gigabyte

I just want to know whether there is a way to fix this or if I need a new mother board or gpu.

TITLE:  How to get baby ball pytgon to eat???
BODY: I have tried over a month to get my baby ball python, Zephyr to eat. I got him from an expo and I dont think he ate. I tried leaving him alone for a week and trying again. Today he was sort of staring at it or staring into space? I tried to pinch the prekilled pinks nose to get a lottle blood out, still didnt work. I left it in his enclosure for the night right in front of the opening. I did that once before but it didnt work. He is an active snake at night. I mean a very active snake. He goes all around the enclosure. I also noticed he is getting a little skinnier. I am a little worried about him. I know snakes can go off feed for weeks and even months but I dont know about him. I also have a sand boa, who eats perfectly. So I have experience with snakes. I don't know what to do now? Hmmmm.....

After a few days of trying to get them to drink the milk replacer, I found out they have been eating the mothers dry kitten kibble!!! They refuse to eat any wet kitten food and only take one or two licks of the milk replacer but they go to town on the kibble! Is this ok for them??? 

They are pooping normally (started using the litter box today!!!!😅). Thanks in advance

TITLE:  Computer Temperature?
BODY: Can you tell me the average temperature of these specs?

GPU: MSI GTX 960
CPU: AMD FX-8320
MOBO: Military Class II (760GMA-P34 (FX) [This is a cheap Motherboard and it usually goes up to 63 Celsius when I'm playing games like H1Z1.
My Power Supply is a 500W Allied AL - D500EXP

Here are my temps when I game:
GPU: 50-62 Celsius
CPU:  Up to 65 Celsius
MOBO : Up to 62 Celsius

I think the Problem is the case, the motherboard doesn't have a place to vent.

If I replace my Motherboard, would that do anything?

If someone can give me a suggestion on how to improve the temperatures, that'd be great.

PS: I use Speccy to find out the temps.

I've been told that having certain colored irises have different effects on the eyes, so I would also like to know if having the color I was is, in any way, possible and not just plain idiotic.

TITLE:  I want to play high school hockey?
BODY: Okay so I have played inline for 5 years with the last two at an elite level and I am going in to the 10th grade. The only experience I have with ice is a few drop ins and one season of rec league. I skipped out on the team last year because I wasnt confident, but this year im gonna give it a try. I can do all of the basic fundamentals except I can't stop on ice very well. As far as working out I usually do around 20 or 30 pushups a day  and run 8 laps around a track every other day, and I shoot for around an hour a day. I plan to do a bantam house league before the HS season starts. What else should I do on+off the ice to improve my game as fast as possible (please note that all of my hockey stuff comes out of my paycheck so I can't really dish out too much on training aids)

BODY: I recently starting working for my boss about a month ago. I have been trying to get an appointment to get my wisdom teeth out for 2 months and finally got one in a few weeks. I immediately filled out a time off request form for my boss and she denied my request. The day my procedure is scheduled, is the same day the whole staff is suppose to go to a seminar, so she said this was the reason she denied my request, also because she said she doesn't give new employees time off for the first 3 months. But my wisdom teeth hurt me really bad (to the point where they keep me up at night) and the next appointment date would be in another month. Is she allowed to do this?

Please reply only if you have actual experience doing that (instead of just listing a website).  Thank you.

BODY: I'm looking to buy a new set of irons. I'm currently gaming the Ping G30s, but i don't know what it is about irons with the fat head that makes me not be able to play them. I shoot in the upper 80's, so I am looking for something forgiving, but without the big thick head. So can anyone refer me to some irons that I should try that fit that description? Thanks

TITLE:  Need help finding the name/examples of a hairstyle?
BODY: Okay, so a couple weeks ago I was at a gathering of sorts when I saw a guy with a haircut/style I REALLY liked, but unfortunately I've never seen anyone else with it and I have no idea it would be called.

Around the sides and back it was practically shaved down, but not fully.
The majority of hair was left on the top, towards the front, where it was kinda ruffled. I'm not if his hair was naturally curly, or if he just styled it that way.

If you could tell me what this hair style is called, or at the very least help me find examples, I'd be eternally grateful.

TITLE:  Old knee injury acting up?
BODY: Two years ago on Christmas, I tripped over the handle of a broom in my kitchen and fell, landing really hard on my right knee. Went to the emergency room and they didnt really say what was wrong, just that I would not need surgery, but that it was obviously injured. Well no ****, sherlock! Anyway, ever since then if I'm on it too much, like walking around all day or going up and down stairs several times, it will start hurting and even feels swollen sometimes. It's been two years since the fall, so why is it still hurting?

TITLE:  My kitten is acting strange after vaccination today...?
BODY: She's about 3 months old. She got a 3 in 1 vaccine and a dewormer. It was hot and she was nervous and slept most of the time on the way if that matters. 
She's eating and using the bathroom. No diarrhea. 
After the vaccine and treatment, she's been sleeping pretty much all day..hasn't played or run around with my other cat like she usually does. She just woke up and it looked like she was limping..not sure if it was just because she had been sleeping for about 5 hrs or if she got hurt. She peed and and now she's falling asleep next to me.
Is this common? Could it just be side effects from the vaccine/dewormer? when i saw her walking weird I started to worry :(

TITLE:  What style hair should I get?
BODY: I reaalllyy want to change up my hair style. I have a picture here from a few months ago before freshman hoco. Ive had swooshy hair for years and it just doesnt feel right anymore. As you can see in the picture, i have a kinda rounder jaw. I wear button up shirts all the time, and my long hair has been constantly hitting the collar which just gets annoying. I want something that doesnt conflict with my shirt very much . If I could chose, I really really want a brushed back hairstyle with a part at my hairline. KINDA like the rapper G-Eazy but im not really a fan of the shaved sides and his hair looks kinda greasy and slicked back instead of brush.

I really dont know hair or anything so if you do leave some suggestions. I read that brushed back hair that is a little tall complements a rounder face.

Also dont be too savage, i know im not the best looking kid so maybe a good haircut will help a little.

TITLE:  Was Hitler a good leader?
BODY: Okay so i bring up this question because if you think about it, Hitler lead his country to success. Capturings of countries. In our point of view, we see him as only a bad guy who committed genocide but he did conquer territories. I say he was a good leader but a bad person for what he did to the jewish community. It's no different than what we Americans or tge british did. British colonized in our land, we took it back then forced the indians out of their territory because we got greedy. We see Hitler as a bad person but we can't call him a bad person for taking land. We only see him bad in that way because he's what, foreign? Not American? We did &amp; do the exact seem thing. So why is it different? Why is Hitler seen as bad for taking land? (let's exclude the genocide part)

My dad made a remark about a cousin of mine being too young to wear contacts who is 14, but when I asked at the optometrist he merely told me to ask my mum. I do not do sports, I want contacts for cosmetic reasons. I feel more confident without glasses, and honestly glasses make me feel underdressed for functions especially those I wear dresses. My mum herself wore contacts when she was 15 or 16 but somehow she doesn't allow me to...

TITLE:  My poor baby kitten is sick, what could be wrong with her?
BODY: She is 11 weeks old, when she was 4-5 weeks old she started throwing everytime after she ate. She was the tiniest kitten in the litter and as of now, is 1/2 the size of the others. She seems to be in pain from throwing up so she stopped eating the kitten food. She rarely drinks water. We took her into the vet, they didn t know what was wrong with her. They kept her overnight, gave her an IV, did some xrays, gave her medicine to take home etc. But no answers and no improvement. We tried stage 2 chicken baby food like the vet suggested and she couldn t keep it down. We finally got her some kitten formula and she has been doing ok with it. She keeps some of it down. However still seems really week. When she stands, she rocks back and fourth until finally falling over like she is dead. Then she sleeps for awhile and sometimes is hard to wake up (sometimes I really think she is dead, its scary). Her meow is very course and raspy almost like her voice box is damaged (but nothing happened to her). She is still tiny and feels like nothing but bones and fur, a few weeks ago at the vet she weighed 12 oz. Anyone have any ideas on what this could be? 

*Throws up when she eats or drinks
*Rocks back and fourth until she falls on her side and sleeps
*Raspy meow (or any noise for that matter)
*Very small and weak
*Doesn t play, or do anything other then walk around and sleep

TITLE:  I have a few questions about knuckle tattoos that are still in the healing process?
BODY: I got my knuckles tattooed on June 23rd. My artist did not cover/bandage them due to their location, though I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the healing process. I washed them with unscented antibacterial soap at least twice a day. I applied A&amp;D ointment for the first three days at least twice a day, then switched to unscented lotion. They ended up scabbing badly. It wasn't as bad as some scabbing I've seen, but it was the worst scabbing I've had on any of my tattoos, of which I currently have five. Some of the scabs got loosened, probably because hands are used for many daily tasks. Most did not fall off prematurely but I think a few did before they should have. The scabs also cracked a bit, I noticed the skin in the cracks was red and raw at one point. I have some areas where there is legitimately no ink whatsoever and other areas where the ink is very dark.

I was wondering if this is a relatively common outcome for knuckle tattoos? Is patchiness/excessive fading something to be expected with finger tattoos? Will my artist be upset with me when I go back into the shop? (He asked me to come back in after 2 weeks) I don't want him to think I didn't take care of them to the best of my ability. I'd like to stay on that shop's good side because they have done all of my tattoos except for one. 

Also very important question: I'm taking a ceramics class very soon and was wondering if I should wear a glove when working with the clay? Or will the tattoos be fine?

TITLE:  Hamster has a rash, what do I do?
BODY: My Nephew's hamster is getting a rash on its shoulders. The fur is getting patchy and the skin is red. Also its other fur is greasy. I looked for ants or fleas, but there aren't any. I had my Nephew start cleaning the cage every weak, but the rash remains. Could it possibly be a heat rash? We have had pretty high temperatures this summer (higher than what is normal) and we don't have AC. All we have are a couple of fans. What should I do? I feel bad for the little guy. Would alloe help? Should we give him cool baths daily  or something? Also, the hamster uses one part of his cage as a potty...but he also sleeps there. My Nephew wondered if the rash cod be from the acid in his urine?

TITLE:  Giving two week old kittens a bath?
BODY: We have a stray cat that we had recently taken in due to the weather as well being pregnant and the dangers of the frequent stray dogs in the area. Momma cat is a proud mother of 5 adorable 2 week old kittens and they are doing so well in eating and no one bothers her kittens so they are all in a nice safe place 24/7. My 14 year old niece is an aspiring veterinarian and "knows it all" she thinks that it is a great idea to give the momma and her 5 kittens a bath tomorrow. Not that I doubt her abilities to give a cat a bath or anything but I think giving 2 week old kittens a bath is a horrible idea. First off why give them a bath? Momma cleans them and her scent is on them. There is nothing wrong with the kittens to make them need a bath. My only problem is that once the kittens are given a bath, the momma isn't going to want anything to do with them. Is there any info on giving kittens a bath at 2 weeks old? If it should be avoided? Or anything? Or am I just over thinking this?

I wear night time contacts so other than making my eye degree back at 0 does it also reduce my blue light level? I recently saw these glasses that reduce blue light and my friend also has it but I wasn t sure if I needed to buy it since I already wear night time contacts. I don t really know what I m talking about so if someone could explain to me that would be fantastic, thank you!

TITLE:  My USB flash drive went from 8GB to 4MB of space. How do i restore it?
BODY: It most likely happened because i removed it without safely ejecting it first. I tried fixing it through"diskpart" , however the "diskpart" itself can't see anything beyond 4MB after i list disk, so this technique didn't work out - it's different kind of problem.
I also tried formating and used a partition manager but it didn't work out too.

So my question is what happened to my flash drive, what caused this problem and how do i fix it?  &gt;-&lt;

TITLE:  New owner, new name for pet?
BODY: usually when a person gets a pet they pick out a name they like, even though said animal has already had another name from a previous owner. Does this in anyway confuse the animal in question? My niece thinks that no matter how old the animal is it will be confused about being called a new name. Not to offend anyone who believes this but I think it's just silly talk. And recently a stray that we've adopted has had kittens and of course my niece has named all of the kittens without anyone else's input and all of them have strange names. She wants everyone to keep the names she's picked out for the kittens and refuses to give the kittens if she knows people will change the names. (We can't keep the kittens) is she just being a stubborn brat or is she really onto something about the animals being confused by a name change( I doubt it) she's a 14 year old who knows it all in case that helps with why this post sounds so ridiculous. Who really wants to go around calling their kitten Mamoroo and Uranus??

BODY: About two weeks ago I dropped 20 kg straight onto my foot and although nothing broke, it swelled up pretty badly and got very bruised. I was on crutches or bed bound and icing it. 

Now the pain is much much better and I can walk normally, but the swelling is still there. I would love to go outside but I can't fit my foot in a shoe, haha.

Any idea on what I can do to help the swelling go down quicker?

TITLE:  How much will my dental insurance cover?
BODY: I have two dental implants which are on both sides of my two front teeth and the crowns look much to short now. This a very noticeable, embarrassing problem. I got them because those teeth just never grew in (it's a common hereditary defect in my family). I have also started to grind my teeth which caused minor chipping on my bottom fronts. I have had the same crowns about 15 years now and don't remember what the insurance paid, if anything. Even though I need them due to a defect I thought they were still technically cosmetic and I suppose the chipping would be the same. I have decent dental coverage (bcbs) if that makes a difference.  Can anyone please tell me more about what insurance will cover or not cover?

BODY: ne1 had facebook steal from credit card when paying 1 dollar to send msg to inbox? it was not phishing, fbook stole it. the cred card co said facebook had made an extra charge. Fbook thought could casually steal an extra dollar when I had only used card once to send a msg. I've heard othrs had fbook steal? Anyone else? Not talking about phishing either. This was directly from fbook, officially. Since some other people ALSO have phished making fake fbook pgs, fbook probably thinks can get away with it n no one will know they did it. Well, it was straight from fbook that it was stolen. Aftr I contacted fbook, no1 responded. Then there was a survey passd out asking if people trust facebook. Way shortly aftr. Probably worried that people know n wanted to find out their thoughts about it. But no email asking more info.

RAM: 8 GB DDR3 1600
GPU: XFX R9 270X 2GB DDR5
HDD: 1 TB WB Blue
OS: Windows 7 64bit

OpenGL: 78 FPS
CPU: 511

Windows benchmark:
Processor: 7.6
Memory: 7.6
Business Graphic: 7.9
Gaming: 7.9
Hard drive: 5.9

Bioschok infinite benchmark:
Average: 45 FPS
Min: 35 FPS
Max: 60 FPS

All the benchmark result is OK.  But in NBA 2K15, sometimes during complex moves, it lags.... probably a glitch?  

I'm thinking of upgrading something.... any advice?

TITLE:  Did the rifles of the American Civil War have a decisive advantage over smooth bores?
BODY: I understand that the Springfield Model 1855 could attain a far tighter grouping than its smooth bore predecessor.
However I doubt the majority of troops in the Civil War had the amount of training to take advantage of it.
The Model 1795 Musket can attain a 12 inch grouping at 80 yards, that would be effective decisive against a wall oncoming men.  However this war rarely the case, as the soldiers of the 18th Century rarely had training sufficient to profit from the 12 inch grouping. 
A minority of troops must have been stunningly effective at shooting the new rifles, however I reckon that the rank and file would have hardly been better than the infantrymen of the Napoleonic Wars. 
Is there something I have missed.

TITLE:  Upper connective tissue inside mouth is in pain?
BODY: It was maybe 3/4 days ago when I was with my girlfriend and she grabbed my upper lip (not hard at all) and immediately I felt a searing pain inside my mouth as if the tissue connecting my upper lip to my gums was cut. The pain still lasts today and it makes it extremely difficult to brush my teeth because the toothpaste burns. I can't even pull my lip up to take a look at it to see what the problem may be because any contact with my upper lip area hurts. (Although the source of the pain has to do with the upper tissue inside my mouth) a few weeks ago I had just got my braces off that I've had in for the past 4 years, I now wear a retainer (it doesn't poke me anywhere in my mouth) and it hurts so bad to put in and out, so I don't wear it like I'm supposed to at this moment. Someone please explain what has happened because It's irritating me because it's making it hard to eat, drink, brush my teeth, and wear my retainer. Please answer quickly and accurately!

TITLE:  Does the RMT strike coming up from 8 July to 10 July affect my 9:30am train from Oxford to Paddington?
BODY: This link https://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/strike has the information about the RMT rail strike coming up and I was a little unsure what was meant for a journey I ll be taking from Oxford to Paddington. It says:

"Services will operate as normal with the following alterations: • Oxford, Reading, London fast services will be operated by turbo trains "

I don t take trains all that often, so I don t know what to expect when I go to catch my train Friday morning. Will I still be able to get to Paddington Station? And when they say "fast services" is my normal 1 hour train from Oxford to London included in that category?

TITLE:  Knee Brace type?
BODY: Okay, so i ride horses and for the past few weeks (I only ride once to maybe twice a week) When we get up into jump position(pictured below), the lower outside of my knee(like there the hollow is diagonally down from the patella when knee is bent at a 45 degree angle w/o pressure) starts to  hurt and gets worse pretty quickly. But I am not very good at stopping and admitting I am in pain, so i have just suffered through 10 min of JP and then tons of trotting and cantering, and actual jumping. Now, a day later it is the worst it  has ever been after riding. Walking is somewhat painful, I have to be careful on the stairs and running isn't fun(im also a runner, so this makes it worse)
Is there any sort of brace i could wear while riding (this particular pain only happens when i ride), and exercises I can do when off the horse to make the problem go away/decrease???

(Picture: We pretty much do this, maybe leaning a bit more forward, for 10 minutes)

TITLE:  How to examine a garter snakes health?/signs of disease?
BODY: I have a wild caught garter snake that I recently caught, and she appears perfectly healthy and active, but I was told it is important to take wild caught garters to the vet for examination for parasites and infections. The problem is the only vets in my area are in mainstream pet shops that only treat dogs and cats and other common animals, and many refuse to treat wild caught or exotic animals. There's one reptile and exotic vet but I've been warned that he harms animals by treating animals that aren't even sick, or making sick ones worse, just so he can charge people more money (yeah, he should be in prison). I just want to check for basic signs of illness until I can find a better option for my snake's care.

TITLE:  Which should I upgrade first? CPU/Mobo or GPU/PSU?
BODY: Current processor: fx 8320 - Wanting to switch over to Intel, I5 4670k/90k and Z97 motherboard. I don't even want to mention the motherboard I have now as it is embarassingly lower-mid end even to say on the internet. It has a 970 in it's name to give you a hint.

Current gpu: An old gtx 760 - I'm looking at an R9 290 at my local computer store that's no doubt cheaper than anywhere else and a nice cheap corsair 650w psu, an up from the 500w I currently have. 

Which is the better option to get first before the other and why?

Our previous cat got run over by a car and I'm scared of death of the same happening with the new one. Is there any way to make cats somewhat afraid of roads&amp;cars?

TITLE:  What hair style should I switch to?
BODY: I reaalllyy want to change up my hair style. I have a picture here from a few months ago before freshman hoco. Ive had swooshy hair for years and it just doesnt feel right anymore. As you can see in the picture, i have a kinda rounder jaw. I wear button up shirts all the time, and my long hair has been constantly hitting the collar which just gets annoying. I want something that doesnt conflict with my shirt very much . If I could chose, I really really want a brushed back hairstyle with a part at my hairline. KINDA like the rapper G-Eazy but im not really a fan of the shaved sides and his hair looks kinda greasy and slicked back instead of brush.

I really dont know hair or anything so if you do leave some suggestions. I read that brushed back hair that is a little tall complements a rounder face.

Also dont be too savage, i know im not the best looking kid so maybe a good haircut will help a little.

TITLE:  How do I convince my parents to let me take Hip Hop dance lessons?
BODY: So yeah, i've always wanted to dance. I just love to dance, it gets my pulse up while doing something fun yet challenging, and recently I've really gotten into Kpop (preferably hiphop) music, so I really want to take dance classes because kpop artists are usually very good at dancing, and I want to be good at dancing too. I tried to tell my parents about it, but they didn't want me to because I already do piano/singing (counts as one because it's once per week where i do both in the same class) and archery (two times a week). So, how do I convince my parents to let me take hip hop dance classes? Please help!

BODY: So I m on a swim team and I went swimming this morning and washed my hair and all... But I have my senior pictures tomorrow morning (I ll be missing swim practice) and I wanted to dye my hair I want to dye it dark brown with a color I used before and liked a lot. When I asked my mom if I could get some and dye my hair she said that the chlorine that s in my hair might react with the dye and turn it green or something. Should I wait until swim team is over and live with the color I have for my pictures? Or is there any logical and scientific explanation that allows me to dye my hair and not have to worry about something going horrifically wrong? I don t just want a simple answer because I want to be sure. If it s okay to, then please explain why thank you :)

TITLE:  Baka Sharks?
BODY: I have a 36 gallon aquarium with 3 pictus catfish and 3 small Bala Sharks. I find it frustrating that the fish supplier would not inform me on how large these fish actually get. I know they like to be in group so I purchased 3, and are fine as of right now. I asked at the time how large they would get and the guy helping me pointed to a larger tricolor that was about 7 inches and he said they would do fine in the tank I have. I m researching and most people say they get between 12-14 inches. I just want to know a clear answer from someone with EXPERIENCE who has owned these sharks. I know someone else with a larger tank who has had them for years and they only got about 7-8 inches. I do not want to overcrowd my tank so what I have now is what I am keeping. I also have a larger filter to help the tank stay cleaner. How big do they actually get and will they be alright as adults if they are the only ones in there with the catfish?

TITLE:  Should I ask my mom about wearing makeup?
BODY: I only wear makeup on special occasions, and it's only light- mascara, eyeshadow and lip gloss. I kind of want to start wearing makeup daily (btw I'm 13), but not a lot, and I've never talked to my mom about it. I went to a birthday party once and she had 2 beauticians over and show us some stuff, so I had it completely done once- foundation, concealer (I think), highlighter, blush, eye liner, eyeshadow, and mascara, I think that's it. And I loved it!! Not being self-absorbed or anything, but I looked so much prettier!!! We were using Profusion Makeup Studio, btw. I've never talked to my mom about it though. I guess I'm scared of growing up, but at the same time I want to? I don't know. Should I talk to her? Should I start wearing makeup?  Should I just wait? I don't know... Thanks for your answers everybody! :-)


Oh and I have hazel eyes, just would wear brown, natural looking eyeshadow.

TITLE:  What would you choose?
BODY: I produce music and run track and field. I hope to be the next big thing out of new jersey. My goals, are my goals. Friends and family say i can not be a big name producer and a professional runner at the same time?

Im aware i have to master one profession to attack another.

So i have taken the choice to train and run for 1 year to try and make it to the OLYMPICS in 2016 or 2020. 

During my track and field off season, I make beats and write or record songs.

 I can run, I was a state champion in high school, and make monster beats and write a good song here and there.

I basically use my songs i wrote and recored to listen to when iwarm up, it gets me mad hype before a track meet.

Do i have to choose or can i do both?

P.S im a big multitasker

For the first 3 days , the cat was fine and chill. Now ,the fourth day, it's being so evil towards me. I am left alone 3 days out of the week until 5. I barely go to the restroom outside my room and she chases me and gets mean. I tell my parent and they can't do anything about it .... My stepmom loves the cat and getting rid of it is out of the question. I'm about to just not come as often / long because of the cat. I can't do anything without it: chasing,clawing , biting me, ect.

TITLE:  Wasn't Andy Murray supposed to have the toughest draw?
BODY: I understand that there is no such thing as an easy or tough draw in grand slams because if you want to be a grand slam champion, you have to be able to beat everyone, but, Murray was supposed to have the most difficult time,
'Twas supposed to be Murray vs Tsonga in the 4th round and Murray vs Nadal in the QF's and then Federer and potentially Novak in the finals. But it seems like he has had the easiest of draws. A few upsets this year. A couple of Frenchmen doing well (Gasquet and Simon). Pospisil coming through in 2 very good 5 set matches. Troicki had made it to the Stuttgart finals and looked in good form, he should have won it against Pospisil after being 2 sets to love up.  Turning out to be really exciting this year. Look out for Cilic, he can be dangerous.

BODY: Anonymous because I don't want to seem like a fool, but I was at the Detroit River and saw a British soldier walking outside when I was walking around outside my cabin. They actually looked like a soldier from Waterloo I think, pretty similar, not the revolution from the famous images. They hear footsteps occasionally outside at night, but I don't feel threatened I'm just very interested. Did any battles happen, or any bases, and if so, against who?

TITLE:  Dents in my leopard gecko eggs!! First timer!!?
BODY: So my female leopard gecko laid her first pair of [fertile] eggs yesterday and it was an exciting time. I wasn't prepared for her to lay them that quickly and did not have the incubator and container all set up yet, so to make sure the eggs were warm and safe, I buried them in the dirt in the corner of the tank where the heating pad was. To me they felt safe, and then I returned about an hour later to move them into the incubator and when I took them out of the dirt, I saw that both up them got dents in them and then I was worried that the heating pad was maybe too hot and cooked them. I researched what it means to get dents in eggs and I read that they could possibly be dehydrated and that made sense because I'm that hour they didn't have that much moisture. So I moved them into the incubator and heated it up to about 85 degrees and out plenty of water in to make sure the moister would build up (I did not put water on the eggs). I left them there over night and I just checked on them and they are more dented up then before! One of them still has a red ring but the other doesn't look so promising. Is this normal? What did I do wrong? And if they didn't make it, how long until my gecko will lay more eggs?

TITLE:  Can a snake suffocate while eating?
BODY: Okay so today I was feeding my boa and after a while I noticed he wasn't moving and didn't make any progress with eating...That has never happened before so I nudged his feeding box a bit. 
When nothing happened I started to freak out a little bit so I lifted him up and his muscles were totally loose, he was just hanging there...I started freaking out more so in my panic I tried to get the mouse out by tugging at it (at least half of it was still out) but that didn't work and I was afraid I'd pull his teeth out but he still wasn't moving so I grabbed his head and I guess I tried opening his mouth or something (I don't really know what I did) but suddenly he spit the mouse out. 
I put him down and for a couple of seconds nothing happened but then he started sticking out his tongue and moving his jaw and after a minute ot two he started to move around. 
Of course the first thing I did was look up if it is possible for a snake to choke on his food but all articles said no because they have breathing tube that sticks out of their mouth whike eating and that I should just leave him alone..BUT HE LOOKED FREAKING DEAD TO ME AND I WAS SCARED so I did what I did but what I wanted to ask was;
in case it happens again should I really just leave him like that or do something? I would really appreciate your help.

I've known the horse for 2 years and he's very pretty, on the shorter side (14.5 hands, roughly) and has a hilarious personality.

I'd like a complete checklist, please specify (eg "dandy brush, hoof pick, curry comb" instead of "grooming kit.")  Hope that's not too much to ask haha.  Thanks(:

BODY: I've had my bearded dragon, Oscar, since he was about 3 months old. He's now about 5 and a half months old. I still feed him live insects/Phoenix worms twice a day everyday and he gets salad every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I'm just wondering what age I should drop him down to only eating once every day and how I should get him used to eating insects/worms only 2-3 times a week as an adult. I don't want to drastically change his diet, so I want to know how I should ease him into it. Thanks in advance :)

TITLE:  How do I stop my dad from selling my cat???
BODY: I've had my cat for around four years and as you can imagine I love her a lot. I live with my dad and stepmum who are convincing me to sell my cat. The biggest reason is because when I visit my mum I have to bring my cat with me because my dad and stepmum don't stay at home as they usually go on holidays. I visit my mum three times a year; 1 week in Christmas, 1 week in easter and 3 weeks in summer. I'm going for my summer visit but I have to take my cat. My mum doesn't have her own house so she lives with her parents and some siblings. My aunt and grandmother who live with her both have asthma and can't deal with my cat even when I constantly vacuum their house and brush my cat and clean her with wipes. They said they won't let me come if I bring the cat with me but I love the cat and i'm not prepared to make a decision between my cat and my mum. My dad also wants to sell the cat because we are getting a new house and my stepmum always hated my cat so she's convincing him even more by telling him that my cat will ruin the new carpets and furniture. Please help I gave her to my friend last time but now she's not allowed to keep my cat because her mum didn't like it. I have no other people I can give her to and I can't afford a cattery. Pleasee help I only got her when I was 11 so I didn't think all of these complications would come up. i'm 15 now so I can't move out or do anything :( i'm criying because i'm going to miss her so much. I feel like everyone is angry with me too

I have started consistently going out on 6-8 mile runs at a 7:00-7:25 pace. These runs are not overwhelming but they are not conservation pace and I am still quite tired by the end. Should I amp up the pace on these runs because I don't know if they are helping me or not.

TITLE:  White Spots on my teeth! HELP!!!?
BODY: I've had braces on my top teeth for about 9 months now (none on the bottom) and at the bottom of my top teeth there are some very noticeable white spots that I first noticed this morning. Two weeks ago I went to the dentist and said I was brushing very well and should keep it up so I was confused when I saw these white spots. My dentist also recommended to start using a waterpik to make flossing easier with my braces so I got one and started using it about a week ago. Could the waterpik be causing my white spots and if not what? PLEASE HELP

TITLE:  Should I question the dentist?
BODY: Hello! I am in my 40's and went to the dentist today after 20 years due to major anxiety.  The hygienist was very nice and I did fine but she was very careful with me. I was shocked when her and the doctor both showed me the X-Rays and said my teeth looked good for not being in for 20 yrs and my gums were a little irritated/swollen. (Not sure if that is from me constantly picking and flossing for a week before the appt. or due to yucky tooth stuff. She also said I have ZERO cavities! I almost refused to believe it. I have never been a picture of oral health and have lived on junk food my whole life. I was certain that I would need like..2 root canals and have 6 cavities or something. She didn't finish my cleaning and set appt. for 6 months to do the rest which she said she will numb me and use sonic instead of the old school tools like today but I just can't believe that I don't have any major gum disease, decay or anything. They also didn't do any kind of gum pocket probing or anything which I thought was weird too. Anyway, I guess I am normally very skeptical so was wondering if I should get a second opinion. Thx.

TITLE:  Advice for medium-long hair on grown men?
BODY: I'm just bored, but curious too.  I'm one of the lucky men over 30 who's hair is just as thick as it was in high school.  Faintly grey but no balding.  I started at a no. 2 all over buzz cut earlier in the spring and just kind of never went back to the barber.

I'm using nice Pantene conditioner and those intense conditioning packs.  I carefully comb out all links from new growth every shower.  This leaves my hair flowing and soft.

Is there any need for a trim?  I'm planning on getting it trimmed something like an actor or model once it's below my eyebrows and ears.  However, I have this sense that I kind of look like a late 70s tomboy girl.  Any advice?  I've tried an argan oil serum but it doesn't help much with manageability.  Gels don't seem to work well with the oils, so it's like either dapper and staining pillows or dry and fluffy and natural but looking like a bulldyke.

TITLE:  How can I cut down my 400m time by the end of senior year?
BODY: I'm going into my senior year and would like to participate in D1 athletics (track and field). I run my 400m 
In a 52.98 sec and would like to cut it down to a 48 sec roughly if thats possible in about 9-10 months. I've never really done any training in the off season which I am getting into and i gavent done a whole lot of weight training or plyometrics which i am also starting to do. Are there any suggestions, exercises or anything that I could do to help cut my time down that much or is it even possibe? Thanks!

TITLE:  My new kitten is sick. Should I be worried?
BODY: So my gf and I ended up adopting a kitten from a shelter just last week. He was already sick before we adopted him. He has a runny nose, he sometimes sneezes which it sounds like a hiss, and breaths really loud. My gf is going to take him to the vet in an hour but I was wondering if there's something I should be worried about?
Also, is it common for animal that come from a shelter to have flees? We were told they took care of the flees but the same day we adopted him, we probably killed about 20+.
Thanks

TITLE:  How to get out of cut questions? (self harm)?
BODY: So today, in lessons, I was reaching up to write something on the whiteboard and my sleeve came down a bit and I didn't have very new or big cuts but there were a few, like 7-8, they are very small, not deep and almost healed. My two best friends saw them and were like 'umm.... what's this?'. I said it was my hamster and they kept saying like 'hamsters don't do this'. My other friend came over and said 'my hamster does that'. They kept saying stuff like 'do you want to tell us something'. I think they guessed it was self harm (it is). I kept saying it was my hamster and I didn't think they believe it but then in the next lesson I was really cheerful and kept laughing and looking really happy and stuff and then it was home time. They didn't say anything after that and acted normal and on social media they were normal and I think they've forgotten but I'm not sure. What if they bring it up again, what do I say? How can I get out of situations like that because they 'hamster' thing isn't working.

I know what you're thinking, and I am gonna do it somewhere else where it's less obvious but they've seen them now.

Also, I know it's bad, and I am trying to stop so please don't tell me about that. I know it's dangerous but it gives out chemicals to your brain that make you feel happy and it is addictive.I am getting better but it takes time.

Thanks xx

TITLE:  Should I keep this baby lizard?
BODY: I'm not sure if I should let it go. I found it in my bathtub and I've been wanting a reptilian pet, but my mother won't let me. She's already proved that she won't do anything though, like throw it out when i'm not there. I'm not sure of the name of its species but they are very common where i live, which is South California. It has a spotted body and and stripped tail, and it looks like a peach color now because it is a baby. 
Anyways, should I keep it? I would be willing to do research on it and everything but would it survive long? Would it be happy in a tank?

TITLE:  What would happen if you put gel in African American hair? Will it bring out the curls and make it stay curly?
BODY: My twins are biracial and have very thick and curly African American hair. I usually use the LOC method when styling the hair (water, olive oil, leave in conditioner), their hair curls up when it's wet but becomes poofy once dry. Especially now since its summer, their hair puffs out and knots up literally the second we walk out the door. Will gel help their hair stay curly throughout the day? I literally have never used gel on their hair before, I need help haha. We're taking a long train ride later, and I don't want to risk their hair poofing up mid train ride.

TITLE:  Hair coloring question?
BODY: Hello, I could use some help with hair coloring. Any answers, advice, and opinions will be greatly appreciated. 

So over a month ago I died my hair this auburn color but it faded incredibly fast even though I picked the permanent color. I decided to purchase L'oreals black sapphire but my hair was pretty dark and I thought maybe it wouldn't turn out the best unless I lightned my hair first with Revlons color effects platinum. 

Today I used the Revlon to lighten my hair and it worked decently. 

My question is: Am I able to dye it with the black in the same day? 
I'm not impatient or anything, I can wait if need be but if I'm able to put in the black without doing major damage I'd really like to. 
My hair is long and naturally thick. I shampoo and condition every other day. 

I also followed the instructions and let the conditioner from Revlon sit in my hair for a few minutes before rinsing it out.

I've heard horror stories but some sound very extreme so I'd also like to ask:
If I do the coloring on the same day will it do enough damage to possibly make my hair become very brittle and possibly fall out? 

Would the color even show up properly if I use it on the same day as the blonde? 

Should I just wait a month?

Sorry, not used to dying my hair very often. Thanks for the help!

TITLE:  How can I get my picky bearded dragon to eat her veggies again?
BODY: My beardie is 3 years old and already small because of bad genetics, but now she's loosing weight because she won't eat veggies! For the past two years she'd refuse to eat anything but greens. About 2 months ago I gave her some acorn squash and she went nuts for it! And for the past few weeks she'd only eat squash!
I got a food processor so I don't have to spend an hour chopping veggies and it's been really helpful, I'd purposely chop the greens very small so it might trick her (it would look like there's really only squash).  She also only eats her veggies is the edge around the bowl is around an inch or less! I switched  her bowl with a plate and now when she is scratching to get out of her cage she knocks all of the food out of the plate. She won't even eat her veggies from tongs or my hand. I'm also very low on crickets so I have to spare some until my new ones are delivered (I have 8 animals that eat crickets, and I only have 100; that would only last two days). I'm trying to keep her weight stable but it's nearly impossible when she won't eat her veggies!

How can I get her to eat them?
I'm going to switch bowls now and maybe try chopping the veggies myself (I'll update this if she eats).

TITLE:  Is this considered bad poetry?
BODY: Cease and behold! The flowery gate!
It stings my flesh with never ending sight
As I lay down in waste, hoping that
God will lay me down in the quietest of ways.

Usually my poems are intuitive and expressive, but lacking any real meaning. It's as if my poetic expression is bombarded by the shakles of the abyss! Is this considered bad poetry, or am I doing just fine?

TITLE:  My eyes lose focus or are difficult to get into focus?
BODY: I am 15 and I wear glasses (I am nearsighted). My eyes go out of focus a lot, especially when I am reading sheet music (when I play violin). They're not always out of focus, sometimes I don't even realize it, but when I try to get them to focus again it's extremely difficult. Sometimes it just randomly goes into focus, and other times, no matter how hard I try, my vision remains blurred. I'm pretty sure I need to update my prescription, but I don't know if that's what's causing the issues. My eyes aren't always out of focus or anything. It's just sometimes. Is this normal?

TITLE:  Is it true that if a computer partition is damaged, the hard drive would get wiped during the recovery process?
BODY: I brought my computer to a IGS systems in Toronto  when it stopped working. They said that the motherboard was dead but I could transfer the data to an external hard drive or to a new computer. I paid to transfer the data to a new computer but was given back a 250GB hard drive instead of my 750 GB that came with the damaged computer. When I showed proved that they had give me back a different hard drive and after several days of waiting, I got my 750 GB drive back. However, the guy said that the partition was corrupted, so it would have been wiped out during the transfer. Is that right? (please only respond if you have knowledge of data recovery and computers, a guess would not help me). What I think might have happened is that they tried to refurbished it and wiped it with that end in mind. The whole thing smelled, but I would like a second opinion. He said that another computer needed to be use to recover the data but once the data is recovered the partition is gone! and that had I done this else were it would have cost me $700 instead of the $67...it just doesn't add up to me (they had no reason to do me any favours and did not seem to be particularly nice). I think I was taken by crooks... Any knowledgeable opinion would be appreciated.

BODY: She got pills because she was straining to pee (even though there wasn t an infection or blockage.)
I m supposed to give it to her for six days, today s the fifth one and when I gave it to her she swallowed half and spit the other one out, it was all mushed up but I put it in her food and she hasn t eaten it yet. Should I give her another one? Wouldn t it be too much? The vet gave me exactly six pills so if I gave her another one today there won t be one to give her tomorrow. I d call but they re already closed. She spit the other half out**

I know a lot of people say not to leave the bowl down all day, but that's what I've been doing. He has a healthy apetite, both for food and water, but I wonder if there are any foods that could really help him get a healthy weight? He's so sweet, a little timid but coming out of his she'll more and more each day. Thanks for your answers!

TITLE:  Will my semi permanent hair dye ever stop bleeding in the shower?
BODY: I dyed my hair 8 days ago. Originally, I had really dark Asian hair, which is almost black. I bleached it, applied the dye and washed it out as the box said. Then I got some awesome hair. But my problem now is that I ve showered twice already since dying my hair and it hasn t stopped running. Just yesterday it occurred to me that my dye might be running off in the pool on Friday. I ve been really upset about it because obviously I don t want to be bleeding red into the water park pool. I also don t want to wear a swimming cap. 

I talked with a friend and she suggested I try washing my hair till the water runs clear. Now the question is, if I wash my hair till the dye stops bleeding, will I end up with bleached hair? Will the dye wash off completely? It s semi permanent btw. Please help!

If all else fails I ll have to bun my hair up and flinch at every splash of pool water. : (

I got it cut and regained some health. So until then what's the best shade of blonde to dye over a green tint? Something bright or on the darker side? What's a good brand too? The green tint isn't too bad but it's there and i want normal beautiful medium blonde hair.

TITLE:  Eye contacts???
BODY: Last year i had gotten a eye vision test at walmart and they also gave me contacts. But i never used them but now that i regret not using them i wanted to start wearing it again.. Now my problem is i had taken a picture of my contacts prescription but im not sure if its left or right. Can i still order them randomly? I called walmart and they had told me i am not in the system. So i have no choice left but to order randomly by that i mean guessing which one if left or right.

BODY: I was just wondering if 23.2 is a good time for the 150m as a fourteen year old - my 200m time is roughly 29.8 but that was only once and I'm running at a consistent 30.0 now - is that an expected 200 time compared to my 150? 
And also, should I consider training sprint? (I currently train middle distance and I'm not as good as I used to be :/)

TITLE:  Could a person potentially survive a fall from this height, and what are the potential injuries?
BODY: I'm writing a short story for my creative writing class, and my two characters are jumping off a wall to save their lives. I want the most realistic answers I can get.

My characters are taking a leap off an 80 foot wall into a bank of melting snow. I'd estimate anywhere from about a half foot to one and a half feet of snow are left.

Neither characters are active, one is a formerly active person, but is now rather weak, and the other is a girl who hasn't done much activity her whole life. Neither know the first thing about proper falling form. However, it's safe to assume based on how they jumped, body perpendicular to the ground with feet down and holding hands,, that they'd likely land on their feet or backs.

Does anyone know if the fall would be survivable from this height? I mean, I know people have survived from higher, but would it be likely for these two characters to survive? And, if they did survive, what likely injuries would they sustain?

A lovely dance in the passing of nights
A sweet chance to behold the rapid rhymes
Marching my way to my solemnly rights

Oh beauty, is it you that shakes me so
Or the color of your succulent lips
Show me your calm way, so that I may go
Into the sea with your immortal hips

The abysmal waters here are calm
And the holy, white wind blows a cool breeze
My heart is at peace without any harm
I can see what it means to be at ease

So long, pettiness of the undead earth!
No more must I give your life any worth!

BODY: my aquatic turtle is growing blue/green stuff on shell?
I am taking care of my science class aquatic turtle and have been taking care of him for 1 month now. a couple days ago, he started getting this blue stuff on his shell. it kinda looks like blue mold but it isn't and I would like to know what it is and if I'm allowed to touch him. also, I fed him a blueberry before he started growing the blue stuff on his shell.. could it be the blueberry?? he has everything a turtle needs (good amount of water, plenty of swimming space, filter, lamp w/ bulb etc) is he ok? should I do something?? (the pic is kinda blurry sorry but he can't stay still) 
update: I found out turtles can grow algae (or grass) on their shells. could it be grass?

TITLE:  Is it possible to sprint for a few kilometers?
BODY: I started running about 2 weeks ago, and when I started I could only run like 400meters but I stretched that out to 5 kilometers. But, I noticed that running is already becoming easy, so I decided to drastically decrease the amount I run and at the same time increase the speed I run at to nearly as fast as I sprint. Of course I still continue increasing the amount I run by a little each day. But I am curious, what is the approximate distance the human body can sprint at?

TITLE:  Do any of you have experience with raising parrots and if so, do you know a way I could fix "scissors beak" without running to the vet?
BODY: I have an Alexandrine Ringneck, he is 19 years old and in perfect health, other than he has had scissors beak for over a year now.  My vet has confirmed that it's not caused by anything I'm feeding him or doing wrong.  I've had this bird for 16 of those 19 years, I take great care of my baby.

Anyway, his vet moved to another location that is roughly 30 minutes away now, and also this new place costs double the old one.  I was only paying $20 every few months for a beak trim.  But this new place charges $40.  And to top it off, his problem seems to be getting a bit worse in the sense that it is now only take a month to grow out, whereas before it was a few months.  In other words, I just cannot afford to keep running a half hour to the vet once a month and shelling out $40 each time.  Of course I will if it's my only option, I'd do anything for him.  But I'm looking to see if there's anyone with experience with this, who can tell me tips on how to handle it at home to slow down the frequent vet trips.  I seen photos of parrots gnawing on nail files.  Can this really help?  If so, should it be a metal or wooden one?

I do allow him to gnaw on large carrot sticks as a way to try and grind it down, but it doesn't seem to have much effect.  I don't know what to do!!

It's telling me that a Discus is 8 inches and a Platy is 2 and a half. Maybe where I live we only have shrunken fish... or maybe there is something really messed up with all of this. Discus? 8 inches!?!? Please. 8 centimeters on the other hand... Almost exactly. A platy is much closer to 2 and a half centimeters than 2 and a half inches. Clearly I'm missing something. Help!

They would forget to feed him and his claws where growing into his paws, he wasn't given fresh water and his bedding was changed maybe 1 time a month. Instead of a cage for him they had him in a plastic storage box. It is too small for the 3 year old Piggy. I want to get a nice and big cage for him but I'm not sure where.

TITLE:  Wisdom Teeth removal complications? EMERGENCY PLEASE HELP!?
BODY: I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth taken out 3 weeks ago today. Everything was going well, and I hadn't had any swelling last week, just the week I got them out, and then yesterday. I woke up and I noticed I was having pain on my left cheek where the teeth were pulled. I didn't think anything of it, I just thought I'd slept on my face funny. But then throughout the day yesterday I noticed my left cheek starting to swell. By the end of the day it looked like I had just got them removed. It doesn't really hurt, but it feels like a lump near my jaw line and it's a tad sore that's all. I went to my orthodontist today, and he looked and said that it was all inflamed and the tissue was irritated. He said he didn't see any puss or anything, and I didn't have a fever or any infection-like symptoms. He gave me a prescription for an antibiotic to take twice a day for an infection, just in case. He also gave me this rinse which I have to swish around in my mouth twice a day. My face isn't as puffy as it was when I left his office. I noticed the swelling went down a little bit after using the rinse. My orthodontist called my surgeon and talked to him and told him everything, and my surgeon said if it looks, or feels worse tomorrow, that I have to go see him immediately. I'm really scared, and it obviously must be bad if even a doctor doesn't know what's up.I'm extremely worried and this just started yesterday. Has this happened to anyone? What could it be?? Please help!!!!!!!

TITLE:  How can I find the descendants of a man listed in an Oklahoma Homestead document from 1909?
BODY: My family currently owns an Oklahoma homestead patent from 1909 addressed to Charles W. Plummer, Jr. of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. We want to find his descendants because we think they d find this a pretty cool piece of family history.

I think I ve been able to find records of him after searching his name, but I don t know how to find his descendants.

For the record, my mother claims a family friend managed to track them down once and contacted an elderly woman, but apparently her son thought it was some kind of scam and made us stop contact. That was years ago, a bit before I was born, so we don t know if our friend would be able to tell us who it was.

Any advice on how to proceed?

TITLE:  Legal laws regarding property (in this case, pet fish) that a friend has been holding for me. Legally is he allowed to give them away?
BODY: We lived with a family friend, and when we were on vacation, he decided to move within the weekend, I had a tank of fish that I had for 5 years. So, one of his friends, who was kind of my boyfriend, took the fish because there was no where else to put them. The main reason he took them was because he hoped I would spend more time with him, and he said it was completely fine that the fish stayed with him. 

In September 2013 I got an apartment, and he asked if I wanted to take them back yet, and he said it was fine if I didn't, I didn't want to ask the manager if it was ok, so I told him he could keep them for a bit longer. He texted me a few times after, but never about the fish, and eventually, in February 2015, I heard that he gave them away in August 2014 to a friend of his, who sold them for $200.

He gave me the number if the person who he gave them to, but I have gotten no answer from her.

I just wanted to know if he was legally allowed to give them away since he had them for awhile, even though he didn't tell me he was going to give them away if I didn't take them. One of the fish meant a lot to me, and I wanted to try to buy it back. 

If there is anything I could do or say to convince her to tell me who she sold them to, or just to answer me.

Thank you for any help anyone has.

BODY: I ve had my Eastern Paint for over two years now. She lives in a 30 gallon tank, has uvb lighting as well as heat. The temperature of the water stays around 76 degrees F. She basks regularly throughout the day. The problem is she hasn t shed her scutes in quite sometime. I can see where they are coming up and need to shed but she hasn t. Also recently she has been somewhat lethargic. She either sleeps on her basking rock or under it on the bottom of the tank. I feed her a mix of zoo med pellets, kale, romaine, and the occasional blueberry or meal worm. Any help is greatly appreciated.

TITLE:  Can I tame adult cockatiels that have been neglected?
BODY: my sister had to rehome her cockatiels and I offered to take them. I didnt realize that they werernt tame at all. It seems like she was neglecting them. I've looked up how tame them but it all seems to be for young birds. They're both around 5 years old.

One of them is just scared and will fly away and even hurt itself if it sees me near it. The other one hisses and tries to bite at me. I gave them a week and a half to settle down and have been sitting next to their cage everyday for the past month and I've made no progress.

Is it possible to tame them now or is it too late? I'll still care for them even so, but itd be nice if I could let them out of their cage every so often and interract with them.

I wear a light amount of BB cream, concealer under my eyes and on red spots, clear mascara and lip gloss. I wear BB cream instead of concealer because it isn't as thick and clear mascara instead of black (or any other color, I have black eyelashes) because I already have nice eyelashes and this just defines them. I look put together with this and if I'm dressing up I also put on blush and black mascara.

TITLE:  Which fish are best kept with Angelfish?
BODY: I have a 70 gallon tank and I'm planning on getting angelfish. 
Currently I have around 9 large glowlight tetras (I'm planning on upping their numbers to around 15), one peppered cory and two emerald cories, 3 bristlenoses, one black line flying fox and 3 clown loaches.
I originally was planning on Discus, I'm pretty experienced and have kept fish without any problems for a very long time. Because where I live a single discus costs around 200 dollars I decided not to risk it. 
Are angel fish a good idea? Where I live they sell them pretty small. 
Also, around how many would be suitable for my tank size, I don't want to overstock.
I've heard bad things about tetra's but my glowlights are pretty big, around an inch and they've always been super chill.

TITLE:  Simpleton's explanation of "Netstat -a" command?
BODY: Just for reference: I know nothing about computers. Treat the explanation like it were to a grandma or suburban mom.

I read an article that said you could see if someone was hacking your computer by executing "Netstat -a" in the command prompt. I got a bunch of results, including the proto(?), local adress and foriegn address. It also listed the connection type. 

They are connected as follows:
"LISTENING"
"ESTABLISHED"
"CLOSE-WAIT"
and
"TIME-WAIT"

There are a whole bunch of these listed for each category, which I have assumed means multiple people are connected to my computer. 
What does each of the connection types mean; and if it's bad, how do I stop it?

BODY: I used to be the type of girl that went 'au naturale' using only moisturiser and possibly a BB cream on the odd days that i felt like it, but over the past couple of months i've been enjoying wearing makeup more often now using more than i used to (foundation, powder, brow kit, contouring palette, etc...)...and guys have began to notice me and speak to me a lot more now, which i find a little weird (but i'm happy with)...when i didn't wear makeup i was practically invisible to guys and now it's completely the opposite (i'm 17 if that helps)  i've even had guys ask me on a date (which kinda shocked me at first) why are they acting so different now?

They weren't visible until a few hours ago (and I was able to check my emails etc.) Now, the lines are visible and I don't know how to fix it. 

Please don't answer if you don't have an idea.. I hate for people to waste my time and their time. I don't care if you've had similar problems (unless you can help me troubleshoot it). 

I have a picture of what it looks like...yes, the camera is zoomed in...but this is what it looks like with the naked eye on the right side.

TITLE:  What is wrong with my pet mouse? Please help asap?
BODY: So I have two male mice living together, brothers, (I only found out you shouldn't do that a week after I got them, and they get along very well so I altogether with no problems at all so far) and one of them, Algernon, has been acting very ill. I was gone for four days and my mother was caring for them last night she said he was perfectly fine. (Today he is ill). I went to check up on them when I got home and they had food and water. And the food was almost empty, stating they had eaten. I don't know if it was Algernon who ate it or the other one, though. I saw the first one so I assumed the second one (ill) was in one of the tunnels they had made under their house. So a few hours later, I was going to play with them , but betterment awake. They were cuddled in there house and one sprinted out to go on the wheel. Usually Algernon follows but he just sat there and was shaking. I thought he was dead at first though. I whispered his name, no response. I pet him and I could feel his tiny spine very well. I gasped and nudged him. He got up with tired eyes, and was all puffy looking. I picked him up and he felt very heavy, oddly. He had no bumps anywhere, no diarrhea, nothing. I put him down and he went on his wheel and walked on it, which was far from normal behaviour for him... he usually ran at top speed. Please tell me what is wrong! Only if you know a lot about mice though... sorry this is so long I am really scared for my poor baby. :(((((((

TITLE:  Who are the nearest living relatives of Abraham Lincoln?
BODY: I know that he has no direct descendants living today (his great-grandson Robert Beckwith, refused to acknowledge a child born to his third wife).  He also has no collateral descendants (his only brother died in infancy, and his only sister died in trying to give birth to her first child).  It looks like one would have to look beyond his immediate family -- meaning descendants of relatives in his extended family.  Since his mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln, is believed to have been illegitimate, her parentage and relations would be obscured.  What about relations of his father, Thomas Lincoln?

The worst thing is applying foundation on it because it really highlights the spots and makes them more noticeable than they really are. What should I do?

How can I get rid of these spots or make my foundation sit on it better?

He's not afraid but he just seems to not like them. He keeps saying that they're meant to be in the wild and there's no point in keeping pet reptiles or amphibians. Anything critter related except for rodents, birds, cats, and dogs. I disagree with him but I can't really come up with a reason.

TITLE:  Why won t my male betta make the bubble nest?
BODY: I got my male crowntail betta fish 3 days ago. I put him in a 5 gallon tank with some colorful rocks and a plastic plant and 2 decorations to hide in. I put the required amount of de-chlorinator stuff in it. Just today I bought a heater and a filter along with a female crowntail betta. The store said she was 4 1/2 months old. I m not sure how old the male is. I was wanting to breed them. I put the female in a fish bowl next to the tank. He noticed her right away and started showing off to her. She started forming vertical lines on her. I saw on the internet that some Betta s don t start making the bubble nest until after spawning so I went ahead and put her in there. They started chasing eachother. They would stop for a little bit then chase again. I see him blow like 3 bubbles and they pop and he doesn t do it again for a bit. So when is he going to build the nest? I m really anxious and I turned off the filter because the current is pretty strong and I know it would pop the bubbles. Help me please! Thanks

I woke up one morning with an alert saying  so and so wants to add you to iMessage or whatever , being tired, I accepted. Not thinking anything of it. Well last night I tried downloading an app. I put in my password and it said it was incorrect. I tried multiple times. After about 20 trillion times, I decided to send a reset password email. I never got the email, still haven t gotten the email after trying to send it a million times. I ve checked my junk mail, everything. Nothing. I tried answering my Security questions and it s trying to tell me my DOB is incorrect. I don t know what else to do. I found that the odd email that added me was able to receive my iMessages and Facetimes. I took it off but that still doesn t solve my account issue. Please help!

TITLE:  Can anyone help me understand what my CT scan results of my foot mean?
BODY: There is a minimally displaced cortical fragment measuring
approximately 10 mm wide x 8 mm AP x 3 mm in thickness involving the
anterior plantar cortex of the cuboid bone. The small fracture reaches the
articular surface of the cuboid with the base of the fourth metatarsal,
where there is an approximately 1 mm step off. A tiny cortical ossific
fleck is seen along the dorsal aspect of the lateral portion of the cuboid
which could be a tiny avulsion fracture. These fractures do not appear
radiographically apparent. The radiographic abnormality likely corresponds
to an os calcaneus secondarius associated with the dorsal aspect of the
anterior process of the calcaneus. There are degenerative cysts associated
with the pseudoarticulation of this accessory ossicle with the calcaneus.
There is a small os trigonum posteriorly, an incidental finding.

TITLE:  Problem with lag spikes on my PC when I play a majority of games, help?
BODY: Okay, so I've had my computer for about 2-3 years now and this problem didn't start until several months ago. I've tolerated it hoping it would soon go away or maybe it was a trivial issue that only occurs with one game but apparently not. So, basically what happens is I'll go into a game and everything will run perfectly fine and my frame rate will be running smooth. Then shortly after the game/match begins (usually around 30 seconds to a minute after it begins) my frame rate will drop to like 15-20 fps and it'll stay there for about 30 seconds until I hear my computer fan get loud and it'll immediately stop. Sometimes this repeats during the game after a while and it'll repeat that process. I'm guessing it has something to do with either my power supply, CPU fan, or maybe even my BIOS setup. I don't know. I can't find an answer to this problem. 

Here are the specs: 

CPU: AMD Phenom II x6 1100T Processor 3.30 GHz

Motherboard: GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3

RAM: Cosair Vengeance DDR3 16GB

GPU: AMD Sapphire Radeon HD 6870 1GB GDDR5 - 2 sticks

TITLE:  Ideas of what reptile I should get next..?
BODY: Sup everyone I was just posting to see if anyone can help me with what reptile I should get next. I currently have a columbian red tailed boa..a ball python and a piebald ball python. So it is pretty obvious that I LOVE snakes but I'm kinda in search of something different and extraordinary...please do not list the basics that I have heard a million times like leapord/crested geckos,russian tortoise, anoles, turantulas, bearded dragons, Chinese water dragons, monitors, frogs, scorpions, chameleons  etc. I want something that is out and about and shows itself off. I love all my snakes but they hide all the time and don't show there beautiful colors. Maybe something exotic and exciting would be cool. I was thinking maybe a emerald tree boa but they're kind of pricy and I don't trust a lot of people especially with a snake that expensive so if someone would please mention something that I have not listed or a reputable breeder that they themselves have bought a emerald tree boa from that I can get In contact with that would be greatly appreciated

TITLE:  Any possibilities of what might be wrong with my cat?
BODY: My cat is a 10 year female house cat, lately within the last 2-3 weeks she has been very lethargic, has been hiding in the liter box, in our shower and generally in the bathroom. She only comes out to eat and drink then runs back to the bathroom. I just noticed one of her front paws has become swollen and enlarge. She has lost a significant amount of weight within those 2-3 weeks. At the moment I can t afford to take her to the vet unfortunately, and I fear she may pass away shortly she has never shown any of these symptoms for as long as I ve had her.

TITLE:  Thoughts on a dandelion tattoo?
BODY: I've been thinking about getting a tattoo in remembrance of my brother who passed away a few years ago and I'm kind of liking the idea of a dandelion, something like this...

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/cf/68/1c/cf681cd9ce4c0ecdb39e0b1a85e5b730.jpg

...but a little more horizontal than vertical so it can go on the back of my shoulder. I was thinking I could also replace the quote along the stem with his name and the date of his death. To me, it has meaning and I don't think it's something I'll look back on and regret, but I want to get other's opinions on it as well. I'm also open to suggestions! Thanks. (:

TITLE:  How to be a good high school guard?
BODY: I am heading into the ninth grade. This past season as an 8th grader,  I had an OK year (10 PPG). I played alot of small forward and power forward, but I feel that I will be to small to be a HS forward (5'10 150lbs). I want to make Varsity or at least JV as a guard. My defense is good, I have decent handles but they could use some work. I have a good mid range shot and I can score inside but I'm inconsistent from 3. I am a decent free throw shooter (70% last year). What do I have to do to be a good HS guard, and what us the average height of a HS guard?

It would be great if someone could post a link for an adapter and cord or provide some useful info.

I shaved the back of my hands hair and I totally regret it, I shaved it all and it's kind of starting to grow back but there's some parts where it is longer and others where it's just beginning to grow. Is that bad?! Will it grow back equally and how it used to be? How long will it take? 

Thanks :)

TITLE:  What kind of parrot is right for me?
BODY: I want to get a parrot. I am in college and have classes throughout the day, but will have time to clean cage and feed it every day and additionally time to play with and just spend time with her. I would like a snuggly, affectionate bird. I have looked into cockatoos but they seem to go crazy if left alone too long which isn't an issue since I live with my family but I know a bird is lifelong so I do not know what my schedule will be many years in the future. I would never give the bird away if it gets mean, so that isnt an issue for me but personally I would feel bad if I caused it to have issues. So I may like a bird that can handle more stress etc. I have the money to buy the best cage for her, so I can provide for a large bird. I have small dogs but they are actually great around large birds, one even likes having them ride on his back. I have had small birds before but would like to get a larger parrot.

 Overall I would like a larger, affectionate bird that can handle changes in environment without feeling stressed. I would like the bird to be vocal but that isn't as important. The bird will need to be friendly around other people, although I understand that is an issue that can be solved with training and raising the bird correctly. 

Any websites you can give me on birds would help greatly and I appreciate any help on this question. Thanks.

BODY: I decided to dye the ends of my hair (4-6 inches) and I'm finally doing it this week, most likely tomorrow. I'm bleaching my dark brown hair and then I'm planning on dying it bright colors such as purple, pink, or others similar to them. I'm going into my first year of middle school, and my brother said they would think badly about me if I'm in school with my hair. I might cut the colored part off before school if they will.

But overall, what will other people think of me,as I'm only in middle school? And personally, what would you do (would you cut it off, what color, etc.)? Please answer. Best answer gets 10 points!

TITLE:  Hair crisis: what can i do about this dye crisis??
BODY: so it all started when i wanted an ombre and my first hairdresser bleached half of my hair instead of using a dye and didn't even do a proper ombre. So my ombre basically had this straight-across line as the start which didn't look pretty. Next time i try to dye my hair brown to cover up the bleach but this other hairdresser ends up dying half of my hair and bangs a blue/black while my natural hair color is a medium brown/light brown. Now after a couple of months i went to this other hairdresser who agreed to remove the black. So i chose a color that we both thought was closest to my natural hair color. The lady bleaches my hair and my bangs and after the dye process was done, i notice how the dye came out way lighter than i expected and my bangs were still black looking because to lighten them up my hairdresser would've had to bleached them blonde but she didn't want to risk that. Now i don't know what to do. All i wanted was a dye that was close to my natural hair color but i ended up with a lighter brown dye and bangs that are still partially black/darkbrown. My hair dye also has an orange-brassy tone at the moment and i'm just really unhappy. This entire year i've felt so ugly and horrible and don't have any more confidence left because my hair has been chopped up and dyed incorrecty. My hair is also up to my collarbone  because i've been trying to cut off the black dye for a long time. What should i do?

I reinstalled my windows due to problems with my hardware and now I bought a BenQ xl2411z.Everything works fine but before the reinstallation of windows I had 9 GB of RAM and I could use the most part of it (8.99GB if I'm not wrong) but today I noticed that my PC was working quite slowly and when I checked the basic information of the system I saw that from 8.99 GB i went to 5.99GB of usable ram. I don't know that happened here and I don't know what it could be, it's related to the monitor? it is 144 hz.

BODY: So I'm going on vacation on August 21-august 30 and I was wondering whether it's safe to leave my betta fish without food for the whole vacation. I got him may 10 and he was like 3-4 months old at the time and the store said he was a baby so idk if that makes a difference. I do know that they can survive up to 2 weeks with no food I just don't know if that's safe. Also it would be really hard to find someone to take care of him. So what do I do?

TITLE:  When am I supposed to rinse my mouth?
BODY: I just read that rinsing after brushing your teeth is bad. However, the article stated that rinsing after brusing your teeth with WATER is bad because it washes away all the benefits that brusing your teeth gives - it didn't specify if using products such as Listerine also had a negative effect.
So every day, at the time after I finish brushing my teeth, do I use mouthwash and rinse?
If not, when am I supposed to rinse my mouth? Once a day rather than every time I brush my teeth? Once a week?

Also, I just got really painful gingivitis by rinsing my mouth with water instead of mouth-wash and I brush my teeth twice a day and I was perfectly fine before that. Is  rinsing with regular water a viable option? 

I'd appreciate that information, but if it's not possible for you to provide it, when am I supposed to rinse if not after every time I brush my teeth?

Thanks!

BODY: I know red fades farely quickly, and I'm gonna do the whole "Ombre" thing, My hair is naturally dark dirty blonde/light brown, so brown isn't too far off from my color. As for now, my roots are showing, and my hair has faded to an orange-blonde kind of color. So will the brown last? Once i dyed it brown and did highlights then I washed my like everyday (which I don't do anymore so I can make the color last), and the brown faded quick, leaving me blonde with blonde highlights. I'm tired of the light blonde and I love the red, but it's too much to maintain, so how will the brown fair? 
Thank ya'll so much for taking the time to read and answer if you can :) Have a great day!

BODY: I'm an Afro American male and I recently got my hair retwisted two weeks ago... I've been trying to grow dreads for only about three months now, but I've been having a major issue with my hair. Some of my ends unravel or start to become loose and I don't know how to retwist them without nearly messing them up. How do I retwist my own loose coils without messing them up? None of my hair is locked yet so I don't know if I can wash them or not... The loctician says I can wash my hair, but I have to retwist them, and I don't know how to do that yet. Also my twists are a little over two inches in length now, but no locs have begun.

TITLE:  Why has everyone given up on me?
BODY: At sailing, I work hard. I go to every single practice and work my *** off. I worked coaching sailing for 9 weeks straight in a transitional period (U16 boat to Youth boat) to pay for a new hull. I'm rearranging my school schedule to sail and train as much as possible. The team I'm on is unbeatable in Canada. Then, a pair of sisters join the team. Their parents buy them a new boat, they show up half the time because they skip to go to art lessons, and they don't plan on sailing after highschool. It's all: "The sisters are going to do well, the sisters are going to youth worlds, the sisters are going to be amazing." They haven't competed outside the province yet and everyone's focusing on them. I want this. I want to go far, to youth worlds, to the olympics even. But no one cares about work ethic, they care about the sisters who do this for fun.

TITLE:  Problem with lag spikes on my PC when I play a majority of games, please help!?
BODY: I asked this question not too long ago and many people told me to download a monitor to see what temp my CPU is reaching whilst playing to see if anything is overheating. If you're new and have no idea, this is what I wrote previously

"So I've had my computer for about 2-3 years now and this problem didn't start until several months ago. I've tolerated it hoping maybe it was a trivial issue that only occurs with one game but apparently not. So, basically what happens is I'll go into a game and everything will run perfectly fine and my frame rate will be running smooth. Then shortly after the game/match begins (usually around 30 seconds to a minute after it begins) my frame rate will drop to like 15-20 fps and it'll stay there for about 30 seconds until I hear my computer fan get loud and it'll immediately stop. Sometimes this repeats during the game after a while and it'll repeat that process. I'm guessing it has something to do with either my power supply, CPU fan, or maybe even my BIOS setup. I don't know. I can't find an answer to this problem. 

Here are the specs: 

CPU: AMD Phenom II x6 1100T Processor 3.30 GHz 

Motherboard: GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3 

RAM: Cosair Vengeance DDR3 16GB 

GPU: AMD Sapphire Radeon HD 6870 1GB GDDR5 - 2 sticks 

HDD: Western Digital 1TB" 

Now, I've downloaded a monitor and went on my game and used the snipping tool to snapshot the data shown. 

Here's what I got: 

http://postimg.org/image/bmy8ld0m5/ 

http://postimg.org/image/ryn28l5ab/ I took this data the moment the CPU fan got really loud. 

PS: I don't know a whole lot about computers so be lenient if you realize something terribly wrong and stupid of me to not have noticed.

TITLE:  Wrist Sprain/Fracture?
BODY: Today I had softball practice and one of my coaches was hitting grounders and he hit a really hard one at me, it was no a grounder more of a line drive at my knees, my first reaction since I previously have had a knee injury (in 8th grade I dislocated it and has a bunch of problems I am a sophomore now) is to protect my legs and put my glove down there and hope for the best. But it didn t hit my glove instead hit my wrist.on the thumb side right on the bone, at first it was okay, it hurt like hell and you could see the stitches but other than that it was okay. I finished practice but every time I would move it it would tingle and sting and slowly got swollen. Now there is some bruising and on my palm next to my thumb is a spot about a penny that is dark( kinda scary cause idk what it could be?popped something?) . I really don t want to put my parents through taking me to the doctor and nothing be wrong. How long do you think I should wait? My wrist is almost stiff and it pops now when I move it every once in a while..the Brusing is slowly getting worse, but not the ugliest bruise I have. I also have weightlifting and practice tomorrow.. So I m not sure what to do. Should I give it a few days? I ve been following the RICE method too.

TITLE:  I have a problem with my teeth?
BODY: i dont brush my teeth excessively i think i brush them right, i use normal colgate toothpaste every morning and night, for about 2 mins. i use whitening toothpaste every once in a while. My teeth arent crooked i just have a small gap less thick than a penny, and one of my pointy teeth, i cant remember their name( those pointy teeth that vampires have longer than usual) my top left pointy teeth is kind of crooked, not too much really, not very noticeable. The problem is that when i sleep i feel like it kind of bugs my toungue because it doesnt feel even, and i put pressure on it without wanting to during the night. I just play with it with my tounge while im asleep, i dont want to do that because it makes it even more crooked and lately it feels just a little bit loose, and it hurts a little bit. Is there any way to stop playing with my tooth while im asleep? I dont want to make it fall out :/

TITLE:  Question about matching your foundation?
BODY: I don't know but there something strange about me, I always have a problem matching my own foundation but when it come helping other choice their foundation I do just fine. So because of this, I always find myself asking for help in choosing a foundation. I went to bloomingdale and mac store with my sister to pick a foundation. I was match by by the artist/sell person there to be NC30 for the mineralize moisture foundation. I was match to be an NC25 many years ago. When they try it on, my sister along with the artist think it a perfect match for me. The problem now is that when I look at it close up, I can see that it blend down my neck perfectly but when I look from afar, it doesn't seem to match my neck and chest too well. I'm not too sure if it the wrong shade or is it because I have a lot of redness in my skin due to acne scar. My face tend to be lighter then my body and since I"m asian, my chest has more yellow undertone then my face which tend to have a hint of pink undertown to it.

TITLE:  Would a KGB sticker be offensive on a car?
BODY: I have always been very fascinated with the history of the Cold War between the states and the Soviet Union  and anything related to it. Recently I found a sticker online for vehicles that has 'KGB' written in cryllic with a small hammer and sickle symbol beneath it. I find it to be pretty neat, but I feel like it may seem unpatriotic to some people and I really don't want to offend anyone. I'm also a little worried that someone may do something to my car if I put it on there. I live in the south where people will vandalize cars just for having democratic party stickers on them. I feel like my fascination with the Cold War is kind of making me a little blind to any offensiveness that may be there.

TITLE:  Please give me some tips and tricks:
horse picks wrong lead when jumping into canter?
BODY: a Little backstory, she is quite Young 6 or so however she has been ridden western most of her life so she isn't "that used" to reins as i know because my sister rides her western
the contact seems to throw her off so I have read a few tips, and listened to my instructor

here is how i got so far
1. bend slighty with soft squeezes on the inside rein
2. outside rein remains stead and a Little firm so that she doesnt pick the lead on the wrong side
3. slide the leg (outside) a Little back
4. inside squeezes the same time: outside does
5. preferably done in a circle or in the Corner

please note, I have used Variation of cues, however, i am used to my own Pony who has instant reaction to right lead in canter

thank you!

TITLE:  Cat is squinting her eye? Slightly swollen?
BODY: My kitten is a few months old and I just got her about two weeks ago or so. She has had no issues with eating, drinking, playing or using the litter box. However, lately she has had a tendency to blink her right eye considerably more often than her left, and she often squints her right eye. If you look closely it appears a little swollen. I am nervous that my other cat may have scratched it as they are still getting used to each other, but I usually keep her in my room when I'm sleeping or not home so that they don't fight. Another concern is that, since her litter box is in my room and it smells pretty bad, I may have gotten air freshener in her eye. There is no pus or drainage from the eye, but I want to make sure everything is fine. I have a saline salt spray I use for my nose piercing, should I use that? I have no idea what to do! Sorry for this being so long, any answers would be appreciated!

BODY: I want to know what are some signs I'm getting off my braces off early! My ortho told me I was getting them for two year and currently I'm 1 year and 6 months in which means 6 more to go. They never really tighten my braces maybe at least twice but that's it, I have power chains both my top and lower teeth. I had rubber bands but they didn't give me any at my last appt?? I don't know if they forgot which I doubt they did because they read it on the paper and it says I'm wearing rubber bands. I didn't bother asking either because I'm pretty shy but whatever. Im wearing the ones they gave me the month before because I rarely wore them and had a lot left over every time I went back they said my teeth are 'beautiful' and 'perfect'. I don't know, are these signs I'm getting them off?? :D D:

TITLE:  What are some mistakes a boxer could possibly make when tired?
BODY: I'm planning a story based around the sport of boxing—good ol' fist-fighting—and in the beginning, the protagonist is a beginning fighter who's new to the sport.

The protagonist's first bout begins decently, with the fighters seeming to be rather evenly matched...until a few rounds later. Once a few rounds pass, the protagonist begins to grow tired and weary—he starts being sloppy.

Now, I myself don't have much experience with boxing (the only sport I've played is football, with around 10 years of experience), so I don't know any of the mistakes commonly made by tired boxers.

TITLE:  Growing hair out?
BODY: My hair has always taken forever to grow. I cut my hair into a really short pixie cut last year, and over a course of maybe 4 months it grew an inch. I shaved my head about a month ago and it hasnt even grown a centimeter. It's healthy. I shaved it all off so it would grow back healthy because i dyed it a lot, etc. etc. and now i need tips so it grows out a little faster than what it does now. I don't have a lot of money. I heard vitamin D works, but the only Vitamin D i can get my hands on is Vitamin D3(i believe?) Will it still work just as well?

I would really like to know how did they manage to style her hair so it looks like it is a continuous twist and how did they hide the elastic or whatever they used where the twists from both sides meet.

TITLE:  Is my budgie egg bound?
BODY: Hi, I have a budgie who I think might be egg bound. Her abdomen area is a little swollen and thumping right now and you are able to see her vent.It doesn t look swollen or anything and has no poo stuck to it It s going to be the first egg she ll be laying, but she s not even trying to lay it or anything. She has a really good appetite and is acting normal and happy. Do you think she s egg bound, we gave her lots of vitamins and calcium, but she is on an only seed and pellet diet.

The new fan is LOUD though, and seems to be for no apparent reason.
Cleaned it, checked PC heat, etc.
Should I be concerned, or is it harmless?

BODY: I am 18, about 6-10 months ago i was hanging of the side of a 3 story house, fell, and landed with my legs straight not bent, did not stumble nor fall, than continued to run about a 1/3 of a mile. My ankles were black and swollen for days. Did  not go to the doctor. cause i was stupid. The black has gone away, but my veins seem to be darker, red and purple in some places, the smaller ones.  i work all day on them and they really throb.. Its a stinging sensation, if i see a video of someone on a high structure, the bottom of my feet tingle and sting. They pop and make a lot of noise, if i pull on them they like pop out of the sockets.  Ive become addicted to rubbing them, they feel like thre being squeezed into my ankel socket.

TITLE:  Am I going to have a root canal or an extraction?
BODY: My broken tooth started hurting a lot around 1.5 months ago, after my dentist refused to treat it for quite some time, and it started getting infected as well.

Anyways I got on antibiotics for 1 week and then moved on and started looking for a new dentist (haven t found one yet though). 
What s going on now is that the gum above the tooth hurts along with the whole tooth. Not constantly, but when there s some pressure (especially from the cheek/lips). 
Sometimes the tooth has this "shock wave pain" where it will hurt like it just got an electrical shock, but then it goes away pretty soon.

I was thinking of going to a dentist this Friday, but today I woke up and this already-broken tooth broke down even more and I can feel the "walls" of the tooth without any support at all from the inside so I m assuming they are ready to fall off as well. So now I m going to and endo ASAP, in a matter of hours, just to see what he says. I also can t eat (I have this broken, infected molar in one side, a temporary filling that s already falling off on the other molar on the other side, and I m not supposed to eat on neither).

Do you think there s still a chance for this to be saved with a root canal? I had a root canal before and that tooth never hurt nearly as bad as this one already has.

My rat can go from being so sweet to attacking me in a moment; he's given me a whole lot of bloody bites but the worst was yesterday, when he bit so deep I could see my own tissue and had to have stitches. He only does this when he's outside his cage...He's 14 weeks old (I think.) Does he need to be neutered? Or is there a deeper issue here?

TITLE:  Muscle knots in shins (shin splints)?
BODY: Hi guys, me again haven't really got any answers on this subject from before as I don't think it's a common occurrence so I thought I'd try again. 

I have struggled heavily with shin splints for over 4months now, I have tried everything from compression socks to sports massaging along with ice and rest everyday (Iv had X-ray it's not a stress fracture - definitely shin splints)! And I know the reason why I got shin splints Iv stopped that and done nothing but resting!

Iv noticed that iv got a hell of a lot of muscle knots running along both my shins, very painful to rub! I try everyday to rub most of the knots til they go but always re-appear the next day. Rubbing the knots seems to help a little but I don't know if I'm doing more harm than good.

How long do muscle knots take to disappear? 
Do I persurvear with rubbing or is that bad? 
Do most people's shins have lots of muscle knots or is it from my shin splints?
Do muscle knots ever disappear, or are they always there? 

Iv now ordered a foam roller to help roll out some knots from my shins, has anyone used one for shin splints? Any helpful tips? 

I really hope someone has had a past experience or has some knowledge with this subject with muscle knots in shins, hope someone can help! 
Thanks a lot guys, any feedback is good, need as much as possible

Thanks again.

I looked at the before and after changes of thinning hair out, but honestly the appearance didn't really change. Only slightly. So my problem is, I want my thick hair to flatten. I often see wigs (anime hair wigs) flat and really fits the user.

Like that one. You see how the top part is a little puffy? That's perfectly fine. My problem is that the two sides of my head, the hair doesn't exactly stick/ or lay flat on my skin. I just want the hair to be flat, on the sides of my head, specifically. But how can I do that? Is there a conditioner, or some tools or jel? If so, what brand? 
(Yes, I do use a comb hair-straightener.)


(IF YOU HAVE MORE TIME TO SPARE, CONTINUE READING)
Btw I am a girl who takes interest in cosplaying as a guy for anime conventions and what not. And one extra question.. Should I use ace bandage, chest binders, or sport bras to flatten my chest? (To me, I prefer flat breast.. sigh) Or any other suggestions to what I can use to flatten my chest for cosplaying? Combinations? Such as sport bras on top of ace bandages? 


Please help me out!

TITLE:  Problems after dental surgery?
BODY: Four days ago I had 4 adult premolars removed, one from each corner, and my upper right canine exposed with a plate fitted. A couple of days into recovery I was experiencing constant excruciating pain in both of the lower extraction sites so an out of hours gp prescribed me some strong co-codamol. I had to stop taking this as it was making me very sick. However, now all I have eaten in four days is one bowl of tomato soup and although the pain is subsiding, I can't manage to eat very much. 
1.) what should I try to eat that easy to eat and will help my energy levels?
2.) when will the pain and discomfort stop?
3.) when will I get back to my normal diet?
Please answer I'm in agony and have been for over 80 hours, I'd love to get back to work tomorrow.

TITLE:  Why don't I like wearing my hair down?
BODY: I have thick curly dark red hair that falls just below my shoulders. I often struggle to control it as it goes really frizzy really easily. I always tie it up in a pony tail or in a plait. I haven't warn it down ever since I was 5. I hate people seeing it out and I feel really uncomfortable with it out. 
Why don't I like wearing it out?????
Also, I don't have a straightener!
Thanks xx

TITLE:  How to get manic panic out ( NO BLEACHING)?
BODY: I dyed my hair Manic Panic Voodoo Blue and I love it but I'm getting tired of the color and I want my blonde hair back. I've heard a lot of different ideas to remove it and bleaching is one but I'm not willing to damage my natural hair colors just to get dye out. The dye has been in for about two weeks and has barely faded. My bangs are still blue and the rest of my hair is seaweed green. Bangs are blue from dying over them before the dye washed out. Anyway. Any ideas to get this stuff out before school starts?

TITLE:  Could my cat have hyperesthesia?
BODY:  I have a black domestic shorthair, about 10 months old. Everytime you touch her, she makes some kind of noise, and she is constantly grooming herself. I've also noticed, especially when she lays by me, that every five minutes or so she will start shaking all over, and suddenly stop, then do it again a little bit later. Even right now, watching her, her face/ears keep twitching. Her tail also twitches often, almost like a rattlesnake's, I've never seen anything like it.

Surely there would be no one left in Australia if Fraser's policy was implemented? Do you think it's a good idea or blatant racism?

TITLE:  Why does my cat have small scabby spots on the bridge of his nose?
BODY: I have an all black, long haired, indoor/outdoor cat named Fade. He spends a lot more time outside than inside and these scabby spots have just recently appeared over the last two weeks. He doesn't itch them and doesn't seem to be bothered by them at all. But, the scabs come off fairly easily and he is losing hair where they appear. The spots are multiple and are no larger than a small bead. When they come off, the areas where they were are red and no liquid comes off them. He has no breathing problems or sneezing. He's not overgrooming and has had no changes to his diet or surroundings. This is the first time this has happened to any cat I've ever had, and I'm not sure of what it could be. Any answers would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much in advance.

TITLE:  My new kitten is mean to my dog?
BODY: I just brought a new kitten home, she is two months old. Already at home I have two dogs, a cocker spaniel and a terrier, and a cat. My cocker spaniel is a sissy and is terrified of the kitten. The kitten hisses and spits and tries to claw at her (never scratched her because I haven't let them get that close enough yet). Is this just a natural cat thing? In addition to it being in a home for the first time? Will this go away in time once they get to know each other better? Any tips for introducing them slowly? Also, my other cat hisses at the kitten and swats at it although the kitten doesn't seem to mind the cat. My cat has lived with other cats since it was a kitten (other cat I had died a few months back), is this just the same thing, all the animals need time to adjust? Thanks for any advice!

TITLE:  I can see my cats 3rd eye lid?
BODY: So for a long time I have been able to see my cats 3rd eye lid. He has be living with us for about 5 - 6 months (he was a stray). I have not had the chance to take him to the vet because it is really expensive here. He also has bald spots (which I think i growing back) and is under weight. He plays, eats and drinks. I always assumed it was due to old age. Could it be because of something or is this normal with old age?

TITLE:  How to stop my lovebird from biting?
BODY: There is a video on how he bites but i will still explain a bit and give some details. He s a peach faced as seen in the video, i got him when he was 2 months old, he was supposed to be hand tamed but i think he was just hand fed because he showed no signs of being tamed , he is now about 5 months old. When he first started biting it was just nibbling and not painful, but procedeed to being quite aggressive , his feathers go up , and sometimes he lunges forward to bite and it is quite painful. He tries to bite when i change his water but not when i change the food because i have to put my whole hand in the cage . I have tried offering him some seeds on my hand , which he only took after biting it a lot, and he hesitated to go on my hand to take more but then didnt. I have let him out of the cage once but all he did was fly around in very high places , it took me about half an hour to catch him and put him back in the cage, so i decided to not let him out until  he is a bit tamed because he was never taught to fly properly and i cant teach him if he flies away from me. I have tried techniques to stop biting like twisting my finger when he bites but he does not give me enough time to do it plus its difficult because it is through the bars of the cage , also tried blowing air in his face when he bites to try to startle him and saying "no" or "no bite" but he seems to get more aggressive.

BODY: I'm going to alter the tattoo (linked below) by turning the skull into a taurus bull and the background into a dreamcatcher. However, because of the tribal look that the tattoo clearly gives off, would this offend or anger native americans since I am not of native american descent? If so, what could I do to change it so the basic idea of the tattoo still remains?

TITLE:  How can I stop my neutered 5 year old cat from spraying?
BODY: My boy is 5 years old and we got him neutered as soon as our vet gave us the okay around 6 months. We moved to a new house a few years ago and thats about the time he started spraying on curtains or any sort of hanging material like table cloths. I know that moving can create anxiety in cats but its been several years now since we've made the move and he still continues to spray. We also have an older spayed female cat that he loves to try to dominate (harassing her, trying to steal her food) and I'm not sure why. Only recently have we had a neighborhood cat coming into our yard but then again the spraying has existed prior so I'm sure thats not the only reason.

We've tried washing everything in vinegar and scrubbing the areas with an enzyme pet cleaner but he STILL goes back to spray. We're at our wits end and we're considering just making him an outdoors cat...which is the worst case scenario as we always keep our cats inside

TITLE:  Is my new dentist right?!?
BODY: My broken lateral incisor was capped with a cermaic crown, but after a few days, it turned dark and grey ( it was like that before capping it). There is a metal post in it, so I thought it was the reason. I went to this new dentist and he said that the cap isn't an all ceramic one otherwise it wouldn't turn dark. He said that the post isn't the reason. One of his suggestions was removing the cap and fixing it without it being capped, and he ensured the darkness wouldn't show! ( a less expensive solution)

TITLE:  Dental insurance after year long college medical leave?
BODY: I received notice in the mail that my dental insurance which is covered through my father by his employer, a SUNY college, has been terminated because I withdrew from my university at the end of the winter '14 semester and didn't return for the spring '15 semester. I am planning on attending as a full time student this fall and have already registered for an 18 credit course load. I'm aware that my health insurance was protected under Michelle's law, prohibiting employers from canceling health insurance during a year long medical leave. I was wondering if there were any policies which protected dental insurance in the same way or if my insurance would kick back in once they were notified that I was returning as a full time student. I am contacting the company soon but would like as much supporting information as possible.. Thanks in advance.

TITLE:  Should I wash and blow dry my hair before straightening it?
BODY: Recently, I've gotten my hair cut short. Now, when it settles, it morphes into weird shapes, so I've got to straighten it everyday. Do I need to wash and blow dry it before straightening? I really want to keep it as healthy as possible.

TITLE:  Will my dentist be mad if I go to an endo for a root canal?
BODY: I'm a very very phobic and anxious person regarding dental work (crying, panic attacks, breathing troubles, etc). 

My general dentist that I've had for 3 years, gave me a root canal last year. It went okay, but there was still some pain that I was seeking out to avoid, since I'm now needing another root canal. She also didn't take any X-Rays or anything, since she's no expert in root canals.
She also just bought nitrous oxide exactly because of patients like me (called me yesterday just to say it).

Anyways, I'm considering going to a specialized endo to have this root canal. I will ask for a X-Ray and I will ask how the procedure will go and the exact amount of pain involved, and the sedation choices. If the pain is the same and/or the endo doesn't offer sedation, I'm going through with my general dentist.
Otherwise I'll get treated by an endo.

The thing is, after I have the root canal, I still need to treat - at least - the other tooth that my dentist did the root canal on, because it still needs to be prepped for a crown. Do you think she'll be mad if I come in to treat that tooth and she sees I already took care of the infected one?

TITLE:  Is okay to give this hamster a new cage?
BODY: I m buying a hamster off of craigslist; she comes with a cage but I already have a cage. I m tight on money right now (I was gonna purchase her with birthday money, but since the owner never got back to me until now, I just assumed that they were no longer selling the hamster and so I bought other things), so I d rather just save money by not buying her a cage. At the same time I don t want to stress her out to the point of her getting wet tail or something. She s also already a year old; not sure if that s old in hamster years. Should I just suck it up and take her with her cage, or is it okay to put her in the cage I have?

TITLE:  Changing aquarium gravel, temporary move from one aquarium to another?
BODY: I decided that my aquarium sucks and it is unhealthy. So I will change aquarium gravel and add live plants. I want to buy another fish tank without equipment and add my filter, and the hood (maybe). So if I buy another fish tank and add a cycled filter and let it run without fish for a day or two would it be cycled enough for an angelfish, three danios and a hoplo. They would need to live in there for a week until I cycle my main tank enough. Then I would add all my fish in there so I can clean my main fish tank and add new substrate, plants and decorations. Any recommendations for a gravel? I heard about a type of gravel that eats all feces and uneaten food. Is it suitable for freshwater fish tank?

The pupil has a weird shape, more like a cat eye with "a pizza slice" on the side. Does anyone know a very good doctor or a clinic that specializes in iris surgeries. It is a rare case and we found only two doctors so far in the whole country. I appreciate if you can suggest something. Thanks a lot

TITLE:  Why aren't Latin Americans condemned for their history?
BODY: while those Mexicans, South &amp; Central Americans also descend from European conquest, who also engaged in African enslavement and also exploited and massacred a large portion of the Natives. 

You'll say that more Natives were acculturated and less killed in Latin america while slavery also ended earlier. 

If killing "less" Natives and ending slavery a little earlier is interpreted as a "more desirable" history.. then why is Latin America not the more desirable society. Why is the U.S. the more sought after place to live in, including Latin Americans, when it supposedly has the more condemned history

TITLE:  Can cats get Lyme s disease?
BODY: my indoor cat got outside for a few days the other morning... he came back in with a small bald patch on his leg... there is a brown dot with very slight amounts of liquid coming out of it in the middle of the bald spot and a very light, barely noticeable ring around the brown dot... I think this could be Lyme s disease... my vet is a family friend so she does all of my vet work for free so I feel skeptical about bringing my animals to her for every little worry I have, especially since I m usually able to effectively diagnose and treat my animals on my own... so if anyone knows of anything I should be monitoring or watching out for on my cat, any input would be great!

BODY: I have some big goals or dreams that I want, and I realize I have to do a lot of growing up and maturing in order to get that, and I'm giving myself a specific time frame in order to get it done. I know I have a lot of work to do and I want to do it. Do you see anything wrong with me wanting to grow up? I know it may seem a little hysterical because most people say I hate growing up or it sucks and me I want to and strive to do it.

BODY: Hi, someone from iExplore rang me today and at first I thought it was Microsoft for some reason so I went to my PC and they told me that some hackers from new Mexico had hacked my PC. I started asking them questions and it felt like they were reading from a script. They opened CMD, opened all the things that read Established and time_wait or something. Should I be worried? I read somewhere that it's a scam and knew it was when they were telling me to buy something. Any way to see if they altered my PC or if they have my IP address?

TITLE:  Are these bubbles from my betta or from my filter?
BODY: Hello! I have a female and a male in a 7 gallon tank together in hopes to breed them. They have been chasing eachother around and I see a little white thing where her egg spot is. I just bought the filter yesterday along with the female. My filter creates a pretty strong current so I turn it off when I feed them. Lately he has been spending a lot of time over by the filter. I turned it off and saw about 6 bubbles in a row. I also saw him try to add one to it but it popped after it got added. I don't know if this is from the filter or if he is finally making the bubble nest. Please help! Thanks

Which of these styles would let me resemble that while still working with my own color?

TITLE:  Is a long living goldfish really so unusual?
BODY: I've had a goldfish I got from a carnival for about 4 years. I automatically knew she shouldn't be kept in a bowl, so I got her a 5 gallon tank with a filter, which increased to 10 gallon, then 15 gallon, and now 20 gallon. She's about 5 inches now and happy as happy can be. People keep telling me how insane it is that she's lived so long but I believe that if you take good care of any animal, regardless of what type, they can live a long and happy life. Is my philosophy true or did I just get lucky with a really resilient goldfish? (Note: I already know she is pretty strong, as she's survived a jump out of her cage, leaving her out of water for a good 5 minutes, as well as a disease that I forget the name of. She's quite the trooper!)

BODY: So I had dyed my hair with ion color brilliance brights rose over bleached hair and it was a complete disaster, just awful. It did not get to any of my roots, and was spotty. My hair still had some light orange from bleaching at the ends but Ihad it bleached out 7 times(over time, my hair is perfectly healthy) and everything else was light almost white blonde, everything came out with an all over awful peach color. So I took the pink out with vitamin c. Can I just put n rage bubble gum pink on it since I took out some of the old color with the vitamin c or do i really have to bleach it again? I'm going for a lightish pink.

BODY: So occasionally, out of the blue, my computer will suddenly just turn to a black screen which is flickering gray in some parts (really annoying in CS:GO Matchmaking games). I can still hear audio for a limited time, but I can't input anything into the computer (Such as space bar not pausing the audio if I was watching a YouTube video). After about 15 seconds, the audio cuts out too and I am forced to hard shutdown my computer and restart it. Oh, and the problem seems to happen most commonly after either: 1) I left the computer alone for an extended period of time (15-20 mins) without putting it into Sleep mode, or 2) I just turned my computer on for the first time that day.

TITLE:  Would this enclosure be good for a green iggy?
BODY: Would this enclosure be a good starter for an iguana... Maybe permanent? The cage is a bar cage BUT I would insubate it on the inside and outside of the bars so it stays warm and the iggy doesnt burn him/herself on the bars. I would put the bulbs at the top. 
Overall dimensions:62" H x 32" W x 23" D
Thanks!

TITLE:  My elderly cat is acting unordinary- sleeping non stop, meowing funny, has a lack of energy and doesn't seem to be eating. What should I do?
BODY: My wife and I came back this Sunday after leaving Friday to find our 17yo Siamese cat hadn't rushed to the door. She is usually energetic,talkative, can still jump up on our bar stools treats etc,but she was rolled up in the closet making some weird meows when we greeted her and petted her, not the demanding/attentive ones we normally get. We thought maybe she was just mad because we recently had a young stray have a small litter and we brought them into a room because she was showing signs of heat exhaustion (this was a little over 2 weeks ago) and she was alone with them for the while (even though she was in a closed off room while our cat gets the rest of the house). She doesn't like other cats at all, and we figured it was just that. But yesterday she was the same, sleeping, and not meowing much nor the same, but would still purr when we petted her. She didn't sleep with us as like she used before, and we brought her up there, but she left after an hour to the same spot. She doesn't seemed to be eating much, including the wet food we typically serve her, nor kitty treats, which she'd always meow like crazy for. It's all happened so fast, and we thought maybe she's just sick? After this morning being the same we've decided we need to take action, but I don't want to waste money for nothing. I'm afraid of being charged for a checkup and told nothing I don't know, then sent to a specialist.This cat was my wife's mothers and is very important,is there a better way about this?

TITLE:  I adopted a abused cat?
BODY: I recently adopted a adorable white kitten who is about 1 years old but sadly was previously abused and he is just terrified of everything even me! If i walk it to the room he is napping in he is on red alert the whole time if i slightly move he jumps up when i do quick hand motions he flinched back. He pees in all the corners of the house and is always hiding under something. Sometime if i walk to him to fast to pet him he will get very aggressive  hissing and trying to swipe at me. At night he lets of awful loud meows like hes in pain The other day i had the TV on and te yelling from the TV had him balled up in the corner of the room shaking he even peed right there i felt awful I really want to help him feel at home and let him know i will never hurt him .

BODY: I know for a fact she didn't block me, because I searched for myself and followed myself on her phone. I've blocked people in the past and it doesn't even show them in search results once you block them. Anyway, I followed myself from her phone, and my follower count went up by one, but I didn't get a notification. She didn't show up in my followers, and I can't search for her.  I know when you block someone, you can click on their name (like if they comment on your friends post) and see a blank profile with their name, but I checked my friends follower list after she followed him, and she didn't even show up there.  Her account isn't private either. It's just really frustrating to me, does anyone know why this glitch happens or how to fix it?

TITLE:  What does this poem mean? like every line and verse?
BODY: my best friend wrote it:

beauty stares

gently awakens
breezes by softly
silence speaks
yeah beauty stares

so wise yet so unnoticed
so bold I say the boldest

rest and sleeps 
oh so careless, so free
distracted by turmoil
beauty stares
so confused yet so misunderstood

wrist bleeding invisibly
pain never leaves
turns to the vibrations to put it to sleep
knocked out, stands naked
beauty stares
sensations and temptations

so in depth, only stops thinking once
heart's stops shaking
just go to sleep instead
just stop thinking

once its revealed there's no more sealed

wrist isn't healed
so just let moans kill
relieving the pain that was gained
guess whos the luckiest

aroused once
a rose never runs

beauty stares
seeks unneeded affection
oh so much attention
dead love with no face
guess theres no room for fate
wheres my forever love?
guess theres no room for fate

my diamond in the rough

body revealed
even though you wish your heart was

independent delighted flower
gentle but fierce

beauty stares

TITLE:  Blackout/Convulsion while standing up?
BODY: For the past 2 hours, I was sitting on the floor with my coffee table in front of me, playing on my laptop. I always do this, But recently I have been going out and getting air, and proper food. I have been worse before, I have sat down longer than 2 hours before, but this occurrence has never happened.
What happened was:
My mom called upstairs looking for something. I went to go look for it in my sister's room, so I stood up. I was a teeny bit dizzy; but that always happens. But that's usually it. 
But as soon as I got into the hallway, right outside my door, I couldn't see. My eyesight went away and I blackened out, while standing up. My whole body went limp and was convulsing, I couldn't even think of anything, my mind just went blank and I was shuffling as I only heard the pressure in my brain and me thumping around and moving, trying to keep myself upright. I stumbled into my sister's room, finally and I only murmured, "Whoa.. what..?" My mom did not see this, but I think it would've been frightening. I thought I just tumbled, but I am for sure I went into a violent convulsion. I couldn't even control myself. 
It was pretty scary. Does anyone know what this could be?

TITLE:  Why do people keep saying Lebron os more athletic then Kobe was?
BODY: What are they talking about? What athletically difficult feats have you seen him do? I've seen Kobe do a 360 layup, 360 dunks, between the legs self alley oop dunk, behind the back dunks and layups on defenders, under the basket reverse dunks, split two defenders self alley oop dunk, 62 in 3 quarters, 81 in a game at 6ft 6, etc. I've seen Lebron do none of these but the reverse dunk at 2 inches taller. Maybe if he played another sport but at basketball? Are these people tarded? The only thing I can say is he's fast for his size but he's not as agile as Kobe, Wall, Griffen, or even Richardson was.

TITLE:  Baby birds in the rain?
BODY: My mother has been stressing out about some baby birds that live outside her house, and is afraid they're going to drown in the rain. We live in Florida, and it's summertime, so it rains all the time. I couldn't find anything when I looked it up, probably because it seems like such a dumb question, but I just want to give my mother some peace of mind so she'll stop stressing, and also so she doesn't hurt the birds and become even more stressed. She says it's some type of dove, and it lives on a bougainvillea tree just outside her back porch, if that helps.

BODY: Someone said if I accepted this warning then my college IS allowed to look in my computer. I don't think that should be allowed because personal photos, credit card info and passwords would all be at risk. I think hacking me through an online class would be illegal even if I pressed OK after the warning. What should I do to find out if I'm being hacked? I only accepted to get on anyway because I HAVE TO do my classes. Please tell me if this is legal and what can I do to find out? They are most likely hacking me because I've worked with a newspaper to expose the school and they probably want to know what my next moves are.

TITLE:  Is this set up good for hatching frog eggs?
BODY: Ok, I should tell you why I'm hatching them real quick. I found them at the creek, they were in my way, as that area Is frequently disturbed. By me. So I brought them home, I'm going to hatch them all, and when that happens, I'm going to release them back into the wild. I just didn't want to kill them by stepping on them or whatever else I could do. 

I'm unsure of the wattage the light bulb is, but it gives off heat. They are in about an inch of water. The eggs sink though, so they are mostly at the bottom. 

When I found them they were stuck to a grasslike weed, half in, half out of the water. They were in the shade, but my houses AC would bring the water temp down so I put the lamp on them so they wouldn't freeze. Is there anything else I should do? The water that's in there was taken from the creek. It's clean, with the acception of one little water bug but its smaller than a pen head so I didn't worry about it. I removed the two mosquito larvae that I found in there. Though its weird that there would be any since the creek is flowing there, it just isn't very strong... Because I dammed that tiny area with rocks to corner fish... 

Anyways, is this setup good or do I need to do something else... Also, can I afford to turn the lamp off at night or at least sometime because it's bright and it's in my room, but the eggs can't be elsewhere in the house. The rules

Thanks in advance... Btw I'm putting this in the fish category because ya'll know a bunch. And you guys can help.

TITLE:  Nothing helps my toothache?
BODY: My front tooth just started severely hurting yesterday. I had a dentist appointment just a few months ago and they said there was no sign of an abscess or need for a root canal. It is highly sensitive to touch and sends sharp pains through the tooth not so much the gums. I had a cavity filled on the inside of my tooth at my last appointment, and my tooth is definitely not cracked. Does anybody know what this could be? I've tried swishing salt water in my mouth, alternating ice and heat packs, swishing Listerine, swishing whiskey &amp; liquor, brushing with a salt and pepper paste, ibuprofen, and maximum strength topical gel. Nothing has worked and I'm desperate for a remedy to fix this until I can see a dentist.

I have heard the guppies like it and they dont seem to show signs of swimming problems. But I'm not sure about the neons. Can anyone tell me if my neon tetras are okay? Btw I know my tank is sorta over stocked but they dont seem to have a problem because they swim on different levels and I have lots of room for swimminy

TITLE:  Cat likes me after I punched it...?
BODY: Yes, it was a HUGE mistake for hitting it. I feel terrible. 
Anyway, my girlfriend's cat used to be a HUGE a**hole to me. She (the cat) would NEVER listen to me and she would always hiss at me when I would just be sitting there doing nothing. It pissed me off a great deal. 

Two days ago, I walked by the cat (which was laying on a table) and she thought it would be a good idea to swat at my arm. I lost all control and I swung around and punched her right in the nose (hard enough that she fell off the table) and then screamed at it REALLY loud. I've never seen a cat run away so fast in my life. I didn't even feel bad.

Yesterday, I was in the living room and I saw the cat crouching and hiding under the couch. Its pupils weren't dilated and its ears weren't back, it was just being submissive. Now I felt awful.

And today, she actually jumped up to me, meowing really cutely, and kept begging for my attention and affection. She's NEVER done this before. Is it because I punched her???

BODY: Pretend you are a war correspondent who has taken a time machine back to the French and Indian War. You go back and forth between the French side and the English side to report on the action. You send two articles back to your paper in which you report on the war. In one article you will take the English side, and in the other article, you will take the French side.

    1. In each article, be sure to explain why you are at war with the other side.

    2. Find and upload a map of the French and Indian War to help explain your articles. (You may use one of the maps in this lesson if you like.) Explain which Native American tribe supports your side and why.

    3.Tell about the battle of Quebec and its impact on your country, and about your country's presence in North America. Remember you are writing 2 articles--one that takes the side of the French and one that takes the side of the English during the French and Indian War.

BODY: So I went in this morning to get my hair dyed a chestnut brown and first it turned out really red and I asked them to re do it so they put a darker color over that and now my hair is almost jet black with very red tones. The stylist told me to stay away from shampooing for at least 24 hours. I know if I shampoo with a clarifying shampoo it may lighten the black up a bit but I don't want to make it even more red by revealing the color under the black. Advice?

TITLE:  How will my hair turn out if I dye it black?
BODY: my natural hair colour is a dark, rich brown. i have all over blonde highlights and theyre all throughout my hair and they make my hair look pretty much blonde. ive gotten them redone once since then. im sick of it now, and i want to dye my hair black, which is close to my natural colour, but im worried cus all the highlights are bleached and have colour on top, but then there are other parts of my hair are just my natural dark brown hair. is it going to turn out different on the bleached parts then it will on the natural parts? also im box dyeing it (please dont tell me to go to a salon, i always do and i do not feel like paying for it this time for something i feel like i could do at home) so does anyone recommend a decent box dye?

TITLE:  Why is my hair getting spiral?
BODY: I'm black and ive been natural 8th grade to 10th ( going to 11th now ). I did have perms but I realized I wasn't mature enough to take care of my hair. I've had braids and this summer I took this set of braids out and washed my hair and I noticed some of my hair was getting spiral then after another wash the next couple of days some more of my hair was getting spiral, then today half my head got spiral. I was just wondering because this never happened before with my hair. I don't think it is the shampoo and conditioner because I have used it before I gotten braids.

TITLE:  Which is better to use when I have my wisdom teeth extraction?
BODY: I just got an appointment to pull out my wisdom teeth at this Weymouth Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery place. I'm hesitant whether about using the IV placement or the anesthetic shot. I've had the shot in my gums before; it wasn't so bad. But this is the wisdom teeth we're talking about. And I'm not even 17, where people normally have their wisdom teeth. I have 5, according to my orthodontist and oral surgeon. A few aren't visible, and a few are, just at a side angle. Now the IV placement, I've never experienced it before. And I also don't want to. I don't like pain that much, and what if I wake up during the surgery? My oral surgeon told me that I should have the IV placement, seeing how I was nervous talking about it. But I'm not so sure. There are also a lot of risks to it, like getting nausea and such. I researched it. Now back to the anesthetic. Would I really not feel any pain? I'd like to not feel much pain after the surgery either. They also suggested this gas that makes you more relaxed, but that's out.

TITLE:  Is it normal to have small holes in my gums after wisdom tooth removal?
BODY: I just had my wisdom teeth out about a week and a half ago and there are two small holes (2mm across) in the lower gums where the teeth used to be. I thought it might be dry sockets so I did some research but I don't have any severe pain, just a subtle soreness where the teeth used to be. I do, however, have a bad taste in my mouth and I suspect bad breath though it's hard to tell for myself - and this is even after I've brushed my teeth and mouthwashed. Could these be dry sockets and/or how do I get rid of the bad taste/breath? Thanks!

It doesn't seem like she has been interrupting him at all and I know that I have to take her out after the spawning but what about while he is building and how long will the building take?

TITLE:  Horse has been stubborn lately?
BODY: MY horse has a lot of get up and go. Like it doesn t take much to get him to go from 0 to 60. But the last few times we went out he has refused to go alone which is weird. He would canter off nicely with someone but if we went off alone not only did i have to persist about it i had to be on gourd as he was trying to turn back. Besides making him leave the group is there any other thing I can do to fix this. We ride from anywhere of by ourselves to 100 people. Thats the only issues he has besides the occasional hiccup

Every Tuesday afternoon and every other weekend I visit my dad during the school year, and during the summer I stay at each for a week at a time -- mom, dad, mom, dad, all the way until school starts again. My best friend has rats and I feel like having two tiny companions would help me through the divorce -- someone to talk to and hang out with. But can I carry two female fancy rats between two houses like this?? Would I be able to have a different cage at each house?

I now know that pet shops get their animals from puppy an kitten mills so I don't want to get a cat from there. I'm only 13 and my sister is 17 (18 next month). Me and my sister are planning to get a kitten this summer, with the permission of our parents of course. But they don't want seem interested so me and my sis have to do all the work. I want to adopt at our local animal shelter but it's an extremely long process. Does any one know where I can adopt a kitten and take it home the same day? or does anyone know of any other animal shelters that are adopting out kittens in Boston or Quincy. And if my parents aren't present during the adoption, so you think the shelter might be hesitant to let such young people adopt?

Currently I have access to CVS, Walmart, and Walgreens in my small town, I have to drive an hour for Sally's or Ulta or Sephora, but for the right wax I will!
Any suggestions welcome!

TITLE:  2 Mockingbirds attacking outdoor cat?
BODY: Okay so today I was outside with this stray cat I have been taking care of. I am currently trying to find him a home but I can not let him inside because I already have other cats that are indoor cats. He has been around for a while and he s very sweet and what not. He s pretty much taken to me as an owner and often tries to come inside.... It breaks my heart closing the door on him :(

Anyway I was outside and there were these two mocking birds hanging around near us. The tree I see there nest in is right in front of our apartment. They divedbombed us and we were literally sitting right in front of my door, not showing them any attention at all. I tried to shoo it off but it kept coming back and was specifically divebombing the cat. He ran off into the woods but I m pretty nervous now.

This is the first time I ve seen them doing this and I m worried about them hurting the cat. Is there something I can do to get rid of them? Should I even be worried? I d rather not hurt them but honestly I care about the cat more then them. 

Any advice would be appreciated. :)

BODY: I hit my nail and it ripped half way off and it started bleeding. On YouTube, it says to use a tea bag and nail glue to repair the broken nail. I used nail glue to put the cut tea bag on top of my nail. It did work and my nail is fixed and strong. However, will it heal or will it just stay ripped? The cut is pretty deep so if it doesn't heal, what should I do? Please help!

BODY: So I have a Audiovox 7' Dual Screen Mobile DVD System (model no. PVS69701) and it is all of a sudden broken! The main screen (the one with the dvd player works fine, but the other one doesn't. Everything is all hooked up. I tried searching the web for this but nothing came up. The brightness control does nothing and the screen on the monitor (the one without the dvd player) is just blue. But if you jimmy around some of the cables, the picture shows up for a fleeting moment and is gone again, you can't hold it there. So my question is, Do you know how to fix this or is this not fixable?

TITLE:  Peppered roach care questions?
BODY: A small stores roaches had babies yesterday. I have had hissing cockroaches before but not peppered roaches and had a few questions. 

What are the major diet and housing differences? I have the nymph on coconut husk as a substrate. Do they eat the substrate? 

What foods have you offered that they like? I have some carrot in with it right now. 

I've had scorpions too and will probably use gel cubes or a misting for water. I will provide a heating pad and humidity.

Do they need a colony to thrive or am I okay with the single one I bought? 

Other than that, any info or comments you can offer would be great. The guy at this small store didn't seem to know a whole lot....

TITLE:  Sick cat please help!!!?
BODY: Iwas given a kitten. He was super healthy.  He turned about 1 year old this march. He's my first pet and I know they're a lot of work but I was willing to take care of him.  He is the most aggressive and mean cat u will ever meet but he's super sweet to me and is completely fine at home. However meeting new people and leaving the house makes him super angry he will attack others and will attack even me outside the house because he gets super terrified. I got him fixed but still didn't calm him down. The vet even wanted me to declaw him for everyone's safety but I refused. He recently started trowing up out of no where. He's an indoor and outdoor car. He has never trow up before so I took him to the vet and once again he was agressive.  The doctor couldn't do anything she gave him a shot for nausea. He didn't eat much still after that or bearly drank water. He recently started drinking water and eating again little by little, I thought he was getting better and today (5 days later) he trew up again. Stopped eating again. I'm scared he has something stuck in his tummy. I am desperate no matter where I go they have to charge me a while lot of money to sedate him in order to even exam him.  He's really sweet and loving at home but they mistreat him at every vet I go and way too expensive I don't know what to do

TITLE:  How to treat a trick knee in humans?
BODY: Ever since I was 13 I've been having this problem with my knee and it's been bothering me for over 4yrs and I'm 17 now. My knee would move out of place and go back in and I would be in so much pain and I cant walk for a couple weeks and this has been going on for too long so does anyone know how to treat a trick knee because I'm afraid to play sports because I'll hurt it.

He is the size of an adult maltese and he is very curious and a little territorial about things. I don't feel that I should put the cage in a high area, mostly because of having the risk of a hamster falling to its death. Any advice about how to seperate them? OR Get both of them used to each other?

TITLE:  Is there a way to put my betta out of his misery?
BODY: I have a 13 gallon tank that's split in half, with a male betta on each side. I've had the tank set up for about 7 months now, but have had the one fish for 2 years and the other for a year. I left on a week long vacation, leaving my betta in the care of my sister. I left specific instructions on feeding and water levels and temperatures. I came back, and my younger betta had chewed his entire tail fin off! Somehow he was still swimming around decently and looked like he was healing. However, in the past few days his colors have paled and all he does is lay on the bottom of the tank. He can't swim good at all, and looks to be in a lot of pain. There is no new fin growth, and it looks to be infected. I'm on a VERY tight budget so I can't afford much medication for him, but I would love to save him. I'm not sure any medications will help him now that he is this far gone. Is there any? If not, what is a pain free, suffer free, way to put him out of his misery? It sounds awful, but I hate to see my poor baby Finley suffer.
P.s. if it helps, he has 6.5 gallons to himself, plenty of plants and a log/cave hide. His water is heated to 80F and is filtered and also dechlorinated.

Let me say: This is the best cat I've seen. He's quiet, does what he's told, he's a natural - I love him and I only spent a 6 hours with him. 

Little did I know I'd be allergic to him, and I am so sad right now I don't want to give him back  to the animal shelter in just this hours I feel like we trust eachother and developed a relationship. I want no cat other than him. What do I do? I don't want to send him back but I have to. He finally got out of that place and is now sent back to it. I feel bad :/

TITLE:  How to care for an abandoned Cedar Waxwing?
BODY: I was out for a Run and found a baby Cedar Waxwing. He has feathers, but is not yet capable of flight. He must be about 3 weeks of age, thus is a Fledgling. I looked around in all the trees and he stared at me while I did so. There was a squirrel nest in one tree, and another nest with a robin in it. I can confirm he is not a robin, so I decided to take him home and care for him.

I had prepared to get up every hour and feed him, and when I made him a concentrate of Egg Yolk and Dog Food, he refused to eat it. He thinks of me as his mother, and his hungry, but won't take any food.

Can anyone tell me how to feed him? A spoon, or a syringe? And does anyone have a better idea on feeding technique?

Please don't say "You should just return him" Because I checked high and low for a nest, and I'm pretty sure a grey, yellow tailed bird is not a robin, or a squirrel.

Thanks!

TITLE:  Why didn't that bird fly or search for food?
BODY: Three young sparrows, two learned flying and picked for food, they became efficient and self-dependent in a very short time. The third one never flew, he rolled over the grass and kept acting like a baby (opening his mouth to be fed) but he had same size of the others. 

He died now after his mother stopped feeding him. He probably didn't get food for two days. I gave him some after I found him but he died nevertheless.

What was wrong with the third one? He wasn't smaller than the other two. Why didn't he try to fly or to get food on his own like his siblings?

TITLE:  BLACK PEOPLE: Why do you think black history is considered forbidden knowledge in USA?
BODY: Why do you think anyone that learns or teaches black history white devils and the entities they control try to shut them down and destroy them?

Doesn't this make you want to learn it even more because it's forbidden? This is what drove me to learning about black history as a child. When you learn it it ALWAYS contradicts white history. You find information (especially in ancient Latin) that discredits every white so-called "historian" in America.

TITLE:  Who are your projected picks for the 2016 NBA playoffs?
BODY: The rankings are in no particular order but based on who has the best shot at making the playoffs next year. I know we are only 1 week into free agency but a lot has happened and I am convinced on making a NBA playoff prediction! Here are the picks.

East:
LOCKS: Atlanta, Cleveland, Washington, Chicago
CONTENDERS: Milwaukee, Miami, Indiana
ON THE BUBBLE: Toronto, Brooklyn, Boston, and Orlando

West:
LOCKS: Golden State, San Antonio, Houston, L.A. Clippers
CONTENDERS: Memphis, Dallas, Oklahoma City
ON THE BUBBLE: New Orleans, Utah, Phoenix and Portland

From the East I am going to give Toronto the shot despite being swept in the first round and from the West I am going to go with New Orleans because The Brow is just to good and he can carry the Pelicans to the playoffs all by himself.

Let me know what you think about my playoff picks and I would like to hear your guys picks as well to share and gain knowledge.

TITLE:  Male guppy attacking other male guppy? Please help?
BODY: So I have two male guppies from PetSmart and they were in the same tank together. One is slightly larger. The yellow one (larger one) will bully the smaller one, which is orange. The yellow one hangs out with the females (there are four females) and ignores him, but the girls seem to want to hang out with the orange one as well and will swim up to him and try to get him out of his corner. What can I do about this? Thank you

TITLE:  What are these black lines on my teeth?
BODY: I noticed them a while back, but i assumed it would go away after I brushed my teeth. On the back of my front (bottom) teeth are faint black/grey-ish lines. mostly in between each tooth. On the back of my top front tooth, are two more lines in the middle of the tooth (not connected to the gums or the other teeth near it. 
  
I'm 14 years old and I don't brush my teeth very often. I either forget or am too lazy. I never got into the habit of doing it every morning/night but i'm trying to get into the habit now. I know i might be too late but better late than never. 

I tried brushing away the lines and flossing but they won't go away! I'm really nervous :/

BODY: I bought a box of computer stuff and there was a graphics card and that was the main reason i bought it. I tried to use it right when i got home and then turned my computer on and It started beeping very loudly but windows loaded up. I did some research and it turns out I need to connect it to the power supply with a six pin connector. I looked all through the computer and I cant find the six pin power connector anywhere. I followed every cable leaving the power supply and I can't find it. Is there something I'm missing or do I need to get a whole new power supply?

Specs

motherboard- Inspiron 530
Ram- 4gb
Hard Drive- 320gb
Graphics Card- EVGA GeForce 8800 GTS
Power Supply- Bestec ATX 0300D5WB 160 watts

TITLE:  Lighting, and transition to fowlr?
BODY: So anyways... in my 20 gallon I have a yellow tang thats beginning to outgrow the small space i have him in... Its a very low end setup. pool filter sand substrate, heater, powerhead, old canister from my oscar's tank, and a uv sterilizer that I've had a very good experience with... the only thing really not low end is the live rock, i got 25 lbs. of that &amp; i'm planning to get 25 more i think. anyways i should have no problem transitioning, I just need to find a different substrate, not that i don't like the pool filter sand, it worked very well for what i needed, but i'm looking for something err whiter... A sand, preferably one i can buy in bulk for cheap :D. if such thing doesn't exist well, i'll have to look into alternatives. Another issue will be the lighting. i'm considering a 3ft dual t5 ballast from home depot or something. i would just need to buy separate lights (i don't know what color temp though, i would want it to be more of a blue/purpleish look of high intensity w/o the benefits/drawbacks of the high intensity light. I also may invest in a protein skimmer down the road... nothing fancy, just a way to cut down on the amount of water changes i do (once a week on this one -_-) but anyways always open to suggestions &amp; good ideas. i love my little (now big) yellow tang, heck, i'd be willing to go even bigger later on... he's one cool fish

Update since i last posted the question. i bought 60 pounds of oolite aragonite sand and am using that... still need lights

TITLE:  Why would my cat not let her kittens use the litter and eat dry food.?
BODY: They are little over four weeks. Just started putting them in the litter box and feeding them dry food yesterday. Every time she sees one in the litter she meows and meows and tries to take them out. And when they had they're first feeding she kept meowing and making growling sounds and would eat the food on them. But she still let them eat. Or she gets all alert when I put her bowl down for them. Even when I tried to use a different bowl. They are eating though, its just she seems nervous.   We don't bug them when they eat or when I put them in the litterbox, I just watch to see what they do and so far a couple went when I put them down. Anyways. Any cat experts that can let me know why she is doing this?

But I want to watch my favorite team the Dodgers but I don't live in California. So streaming is the only way to watch them. ( I know there is a extra ticket but I'm 15 and I don't make a lot of money for it.) I just want to know will it give you a virus?. Because when I tried a pop up said "a virus has been installed. Like an ad. So can I? ( also my dad sometimes use it. I just don't want a virus or he will kill me.

TITLE:  I can't figure out my skin tone?
BODY: I can't figure out my skin tone! I was told by a makeup artist at a makeup consultation appointment that seasonal color analysis-wise, I am clear spring, but I don't think I fit the description. I have olive skin with golden undertones and absolutely no freckles or rosy cheeks. I tan very easily. My eyes have no "flecks" to them and are so dark brown they're almost black. Naturally, my hair is a very dull mousy brown/dirty blonde, but I have been getting blonde highlights for almost three years, and they seem to flatter me pretty well. I look terrible in strawberry pink and bright red lipstick; the most flattering lip color for me is pale pink or brick red with a brownish tint to it. The colors I look best in are evergreen, black, white, dark brown, charcoal gray, mint green, and any shade of pink or purple, black and white especially. I think I look my worst the three primary colors interestingly. Based on this description, do you think I'm warm, cool, or neutral, and what seasonal category do I fall under? Also, what hair color would flatter me best?

TITLE:  How can I convince my mother to not make me get my hair cut?
BODY: I've always had a hard time growing my hair our but I've done SO much research and done so many different experiments that I've finally gotten it to grow longer. Still, it's not long, but if I pull it down it down it reaches just past the top of my breasts. I've worked so hard and I've very proud of my work, which my mom claimed credit for saying she did the work. Anyways! Now she wants me to cut 3 inches off! To some people I know that doesn't sound like a lot, but to me it's a ton! It takes me forever to grow my hair, keep in mind the length I possess now is my whole life's work!!! I don't want to cut it and I told her that it's *my* hair not hers but she said I'll do what she tells me to do! It's not her hair, why does she care? Also I'm pretty sure she's part of the reason my hair is so short because I think she purposefully stunt the growth. I've been to a hair salon once or twice in my life because she's always cut it. Please help, what do I do?!

TITLE:  Parakeet Problem!?
BODY: i have a slight question 
i have had different types of birds as pets for 4 or 5 years now  
in a turn of events i ended up getting two Parakeets, they were not orginally mine and are not very old either, im not to fond of parakeets but i decided to give them a chance, its one male and one female, 
when i brought them to my home i set them up next to my bed in front of a large window, 
I noticed that in the early mornings the female will chirp and then the male will begin to scream, im kind of used to it but after awhile it does wake me up, they tend to do it whenever i go to take a nap or lay my head down on the bed and appear like im asleep, i know they may be doing it just because i should be awake, but it is rather annoying and i want to know if there is a way i can get them to stop screaming whenever i try to go to sleep, 
ive only had them for three days as of now, id appreciate any answers or helpfull tips! as i said, its been awhile since ive owned a parakeet, specially a pair

I know this sounds crazy but I think I'm more nervous about saying something inappropriate rather then the procedure. From anyone else's experience can you tell me how loopy the drugs made you feel and if you can control whats coming out of your mouth. He said the room is going to be spinning and I'm going to say silly things. I know I shouldn't be embarrassed because they hear crazy things every day. But I was just wondering if I'm going to be able to control what I'm saying. Also anxiety about this will bug me forever I can't help it I know I'm insane.

I want to be able to have one monitor display windows and the other monitor display os x through virtualbox on windows. I plan on purchasing a 250gb sata ssd but was wondering how much ram would be needed to run smoothly, would 8gb be enough or should I spend more and get 16gb. Also the processor I currently have is a Intel q6600 quad core 2.4 gHz. I'm kind of new at building desktops (I built a macbook before) so I'm sorry for the lack of knowledge

BODY: So today, at the gym, I was told by a guy who said I should tryout for alternative modeling, My body type is to say the last pretty nice, I have a very low body fat percentage, and very visible cuts moderate size and am quite vascular, my face is thin, I have 4 tattoos a small on my right tricep, two large on the inside of each of my elbows running up my bicep and down my forearm, a large tattoo on my left under forearm, I have snakebite piercings and for the most part a pretty emo/scene type of style, If I could honestly get into something like this I d love it as a way to make money and actual get a very large self esteem boost.

Does it differ from state to state? I live in Utah.

BODY: Occasionally, I will see someone on Facebook with whom I would like to be friends.  For example, someone with whom I went to high school.  I will submit a friend request.  Usually, they accept the friend request within a few minutes or hours, and everything is fine.  Occasionally, however, it will be a day or two, and the friend request is still outstanding.  At that point, I cancel the friend request.  What is the proper etiquette on how long to leave a friend request open for acceptance?

TITLE:  Spine injury: surgery possible?
BODY: So, I met a guy I really like. He's been in a wheelchair for 7 years because of a car accident he got into where he broke his spine. As a result now, he can't use his legs. I don't know the details of the spine injury itself (yet) so I don't know exactly which parts got affected, but I just want to know is there SOME chance or some possibility he can use his legs again? I really like him and I really want to help him because he's so kind and sweet and every quality about him is perfect, but he seems so sad inside it shatters me. I just want to see him walk and smile so big.. the injury also happened in a small town in Brazil so I was thinking maybe because of the low key Portuguese doctors there maybe they couldn't do anything about it, but with the high level medical technology here in the US they can..thanks
Preferably answers from medical specialists

TITLE:  Why are my eyes irritated after about an hour or so when wearing bottom eyeliner?
BODY: I've been wearing bottom eyeliner with absolutely no problem what so ever since sixth grade &amp; am now about to be a senior. But since about two months ago, my eyes start to get irritated after about an hour of wearing my Maybelline eyeliner, it isn't liquid, it's a twisty pen &amp; comes in a green tube. It's only when I wear it on the bottom. The top is perfectly fine. I LOVE wearing bottom eyeliner. It defines my eyes more, but it just irritates them so bad now for no reason, after about an hour or so of having it on. And it just happened so randomly, because I JUST started having this problem after six years of wearing it with no issues. I actually had to go to the school nurse once my junior year for eye drops, because they were so irritated from it. Could someone please help a make-up lover out? Haha. Thank you!

TITLE:  What should I do?! :/?
BODY: Today a cat come to "visit" my family and I and my guess is that he has an owner because there WAS a collar but no license to be found. I gave it some water and cat food and I supplied shelter in case it wasn't going home anytime soon. A few times, it would wander around the backyard; me thinking it's going home now.. each time I got a little heartbroken. My parents won't let me take it inside the house because they said: "since we found it outside and it's not ours, it could be dangerous." Currently it's sitting on the front porch gazing at the passerbyers on the sidewalk and the drivers in their vehicles.. What do I do now? Do j continue "babying" it or just let it be? Thanks :)

I decided not to do cross country anymore, but i wanted to tell my coach about it, but i dont want him getting mad at me thinking im lazy and am not dedicated, but i ll make sure i ll be running over the summer doing my own kind of workouts. Im not really good with talking because i get so scared i usually dont know what to say like how i feel right now. Any advice for my situation would help
Thank you

And also, i live like 6 miles away from school, i would walk, but by the time i get there i d be worn out

TITLE:  My pet mouse squeaks when I touch her back legs. Is she pregnant?!?
BODY: I purchased a female Fancy Mouse at PetSmart approximately one month ago. She is a lovely little pet, and I enjoy her company very much, but I'm afraid either she is pregnant or there is something wrong with her. I've seen similar questions on the internet of the same exact thing, but with no convincing answers. When I pet my mouse, I can pet her back and head without any uproar, however when I touch her back legs/hips area she squeaks loudly and jumps as if I have hurt her in some way. I don't believe she is sick, because she eats, drinks, and exercises daily. I'm not sure what to do or think...

TITLE:  Can you use iodine supplements to treat a possible gill tumor on a goldfish.?
BODY: Hello...

Okay so I have this goldfish which seems to have a gill tumor growing out of his right gill.  (See Photo)

I arrived at this idea from this article:
http://www.fishyportal.com/cgi-bin/pub/diag?c=v&amp;id=82&amp;did=31094823

and this one..

http://www.petmd.com/fish/conditions/cancer/c_fi_Cancer_and_Tumors

So...today I went to the pet store and didnt find any such treatments for a freshwater gold fish...but did find something for marine/salt water fish.

My question is...is it safe to use iodine on fresh water fish?  I wouldnt want to hurt him...while trying to help him.

Thanks

TITLE:  Why does my hair look blonde or redish?
BODY: when I was younger my hair had always been black but 2 years ago it started getting lighter. this year it looks more blonde and reddish and I have this one hair thats completely red. My hair is not blonde or red it looks that way because of the light but that didt use to happen. It is getting lighter tho. My mom even ask me if I had dye my hair which I didt. My brother told me my hair is turning reddish but to me it looks more blondish. No one in my family has blonde or red hair everyone has black hair even my grandparents so idk what's going on.

TITLE:  My boyfriend has a "pet" bobcat, should I report him? Is this dangerous?
BODY: My boyfriend has this pet bobcat. He said that he found it after a thunderstorm severely injured and nearly dead and that he nursed it back to health and didn't realize it was a bobcat until it grew up (he is really stupid when it comes to animals honestly).

He doesn't call it his pet, he says him and the cat have an "agreement". He feeds it table scraps and undesirable meat (he lives on a farm) and it gets rid of vermins. But the cat is tamed and will approach you like a normal cat would and it goes in and out of his house.

I know that that cat is nothing but a full blood bobcat. It is a MASSIVE animal  and how he tamed it I have no idea. 

It is illegal to own those where we live. But honestly I'm not sure if I should report him. He doesn't call, nor honestly treat it, like a pet and he has had it for several years (6 to be exact). What should I do?

TITLE:  My cat keep lookin for her dead kitten. please help me?
BODY: so my kitten just died yesterday and i can't hold my tears. i cried all day long. i already burried my kitten and i'm feeling ok right now although i'm still sad.

but the problems are, the mother cat is still looking for her dead kitten. all she did was meowing the place where my kitten died. last night, i give the mother cat a fish snack. but she won't eat it and she bring it to the place where her kitten died and start meowing. OMG i feel so bad for her. i cried again. it was like she doesn't know her kitten is now leaving forever and will never come back :'( my heart breaks. 

the second is, my dead kitten had a sister and they usually used to always play together, eat together and sleep together.
and now her brother is died and she was like frowning all day long, looking for her brother, always sleeping near the place where her brother died. she was alone and had no friend to play with. :(( my heart so breakk. but good thing is her mother sometimes still accompanying her wherever she go, lick her body (bathing her) and still want to play with her. but still, i'm so sad with this cat drama. 
   
and my question is, how can i try to heal the mother cat sorrow about her kitten? i already bring the mother cat to my kitten grave infront of my garden to let her sniff it but she still don't know everything! :( and how can i entertain my alive kitten who just had lost her brother?

pls help me and thanks for your answer!

I've seen numerous benchmarks reporting FPS into the 100's in BF4 multiplayer on Ultra, but I've only reached 80 with the highest OC on stock voltage. I'm beginning to believe it may be a bad card. Here are my specs for reference.

BODY: My hair's been falling out evet since I've gotten my period, which was when I was 12. Now I'm 15 and the amount of my hair dramatically reduced twice the size it was before! I would shower one day and skip one day and shower again! Everytime I took out my hair bun, which is my daily hair style, I would lose like 20 pieces of hair! Then, I would lose like 50 pieces of hair after brushing! In the shower, I lose like 25-40 pieces of hair! When I wake up in the morning, I have already lost like 10 pieces of my hair!I'm freaking out! I've straightened my hair occasionally, like once every three months! I have thick wavy/curly hair! I have depression and I'm in therapy. I've also stopped brushing my hair for like 4 months now. I still lose a lot of hair though! Please let me know any treatments to hair loss and how to gain new hair?! Thanks!

The NBA has changed a lot to the way that I don't like. I also realize that I need to move on, to find a career, a girlfriend and respects from other humans. 
Well, at last, good luck to the new generations and their fans, especially Kawhi Leonard (FMVP and DPOY) , Danny Green, Jeremy Lin, and old men like Lebron James, Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard, Zach Randolph. Yes Im a bandwagon and I support like 6 teams. Now I will no longer pay attention to any trade news and hopefully not watch NBA again this November.

BODY: Look at the news today, there's currently another 0-day in the wild again affecting the latest version of flash -- even the Chrome version which is supposedly more secure still fails. Flash seems like it needs to be updated at least 3 times a month to plug another security hole. If this software is so full of security holes, then why do people use it? Didn't we go through this debacle like 2 years ago with Java and now Java is mostly gone from browser plugins?

What's the deal guys?

TITLE:  Is it possible to be very ugly without eyeliner?
BODY: I m 19 and I know this sounds like a dumb question, but I started to wear black eyeliner when I was in the sixth grade. At this point, I started dressing nicer and doing my hair, but my bare, medium-sized almond shaped hazel eyes didn t keep up and this is when I felt the need to use makeup and make them pop. Since then, ive only gone 2 days in these 7 years where I haven t lined the top and bottom of my eyes with eyeliner, not too heavy. I barely ever take all of my makeup off even after I wash my face I just wipe from underneath bc if I do, it s scary to look at myself with absolutely no eye makeup. Those 2 days that I went out without reapplying makeup, I ve been asked if I was sick. You csn only imagine how I felt and I went home and immediately reapplied. I find it extremely hard to even look at myself in the mirror after I completely remove all of it. I don t have bad skin. I have a good, tan complexion. The reason that made my angry and insecure enough to ask this was tonight when my mother saw me (not even in direct light) 20 minutes after I washed my fash took off ALL my makeup and moisturized, she asked my my eyes were so dialated, what was wrong with them, looked at me in disgusted, and implied I was on drugs as she held my eye between her fingers and looked disgusted not believing that it was because I had taken off my makeup.

TITLE:  Is it too late to take my rat to the vet?
BODY: My rat has been sick for around 4 months with some kind of respiratory disease I believe. She's very skinny but still eats. And she has red discharge from her Eyes and breathes hard so that's why I assumed respiratory disease. But I haven't had the money to take her to a vet and my boyfriend recently offered to help me pay for her but is it too late?? I really want to get her better :(

TITLE:  Why did my baby bearded dragon die??
BODY: It is 4:40 AM and just about an hour ago my father woke me up out of a deep sleep because my baby bearded dragon is dead. He seemed to be eating fine leading up to tonight. His diet consisted of veggies and worms. (not worms everyday). I also put this special herpititive and calcium products on top of his food... Before I went to sleep tonight, I even sprayed himso he could have some more water and he seemed to be doing just fine. The next thing I know he is dead. Me and my dad loved him so much and took amazing care of him. We have adult beardies in separate cages and they seem to be doing just fine so I really don't know where I went wrong. Can someone please just give me an idea of what could have happened? Thank you.

How can I clean the cage with out letting all of them loose? I go through about 7-8 a day and at 14 cents a peice is pretty expensive so I figured it'd be easier to breed them but don't know how.

However I'm still feeling pain even after I take the hydrocodone pill that was prescribed. When I take it I feel no symptoms at all. I feel the exact same i dont have any impaired abilities or feel high and it doesn't really help the pain. Also I can't even open my jaw and my cheeks feel like they have been cut. My cheeks are also extremely puffy, more than they were yesterday. My throat is very sore as well so it's hard to swallow any food. I would like to ask how I could help this things and when are the stitches going to go away?

TITLE:  Eye flashes?
BODY: I have been having alot of problems with my eyes. I have been to my neurologist several times. Finally got my mri scan back and everything looks normal. He now wants to send me to see a neurologist ophthalmologist. I keep seeing bad flashes in my eyes. Blurred vision. Eye pain. Dots that flash (almost like a firework). And my vision sometimes goes 3d almost. When I'm reading my Kindle the words will pop out at me and when I look away from the book everything looks distorted for a couple minutes then goes back to normal. It's really bothering me. If anyone knows what this could possibly be any help would be great. Thank you

But usually my eye area and the top half of my s-zone vary from being oily to being fairly balanced. Do I have dry skin or combination skin?

(I recently bought a liquid mousse matte foundation from Rimmel London which makes my t-zone and some of my eye area look cakey. I'm not sure if this helps?)

Since the morning the swelling went down, but it hurts really bad, and its itchy, but i do not want to scratch it. What can it be? Its super uncomfortable. Thanks

TITLE:  How to take care for a baby bird?
BODY: I found a baby bird with no feathers he is a few weeks old I think and there is no sign of any feathers showing. I found him in my backyard this morning an he was breathing and I couldn't throw him in the rubbish bin that would be cruelty as he is still alive. I decided to ask you people for any advice on what should I do. Where I live they are not harmful,carriers of disease or anything they are like bird pets where I live but live freely and are very common. Please help me how could I help this bird to stay alive. I am going to upload a picture of a baby bird but it isn't the bird I rescued I found it on the Internet and he look a lot like the bird I found. But he is lighter in colour he doesn't have does dark black line light black lines is what he has and the bird I rescued is a little bit bigger I think. Thank you I am open for any advice you have for me.

TITLE:  Dyed my hair thrice and now I'm blonde?!?
BODY: Ok so my hair is naturally dark brown but for two years now I've been dyeing my hair a medium brown and I like it however my darker hair roots were coming out so I knew it was about time to re-dye my hair however I always wanted to try something crazy like purple so that's what I did. At Sally's, the worker gave me some graying hair dye (said it was less damaging than bleach), 40 developer, a toner, and purple dye. I have bleached my hair in the past and is stanly I could tell that the graying dye wasn't working since some spots were still super dark but anyways I went on with the toner and the purple dye and it didn't look great but it was good enough. Anyways a week later and most of the hair dye fell out so frustrated, I decided to go back to my normal shade of brown but I used a 40 developer and did it the same way I always have don't it however now my hair is golden blonde instead of golden brown?!? Should I try using the same dye but with a 20 developer or just use a box hair dye?

TITLE:  Best Ballet Training in NY for Kids?
BODY: How do schools like Alvin Ailey, BAE, Dance Theater of Harlem, Joffrey, and MYB compare to SAB and JKO (ABT) for ballet training for young kids (think beginner/entry level, ages 6-8)? Can someone please rank the schools I mentioned from best to least? Also, assuming a child has the ability, is it good to primarily train at one school all the way from youth to 18 (besides attending various summer intensives &amp; workshops elsewhere)..or is good to switch it up? (I've been researching some professional ballerinas and many have changed from one great school to another during adolescence.)


Lastly, when considering multiple styles for kids, can you please rank these 3 in terms of their pre-professional training programs for kids: BDC, Steps on Broadway, Peridance. Thanks so much!

TITLE:  Why do braces thin your face? Do they?
BODY: Ive got an oval longish type face and will be getting braces in about 2 months!
Ive read many blogs and articles explaining that braces narrow the face! Is that true? Or does that only apply if you are getting extractions? 
Ive currently got a palate expander in if that makes a difference.
Since I've got a long face already i dont want my face to narrow.
If this does happen - why?
I heared this can happen naturally if someone leaves their mouth open alot or is a mouth breather.
Do braces make you breathe out of your mouth?? 
Thanks!

BODY: Hello! :) So my cockatiel  Peaches has done unusual behavior I have caught her having her thing out and being in the little house we have. little did I know she had an egg. But the thing is I have a indian ringneck he is a baby 3 or 4 months old. He could not know about mating he hasn't even grown a ring yet. And he's bigger than her so it would be impossible for him to go ontop of her. So since she layed 1 egg and still has more to go. what do I do? And since they're unfertilized will they have problems or be able to survive?

TITLE:  Slight pain after cavity fillings?
BODY: I had 3 cavities filled, all 3 teeth in a row, about 44 hours ago. Two were very small, while one was deeper. They were not hurting until about an hour or two ago, and now they are. It's not anything too severe, it's mainly when cold air hits them. I can still talk and eat just fine. I also experience sensitive teeth in general when my allergies are flaring, and I'm a little stopped up, so that could also be a factor.  
Is this normal? The dentist told me I would experience soreness for the next couple days, but I'm a paranoid person and just want to make sure this small pson, or soreness, is normal.

I am suffering from severe anxiety and hypochondria and I know this is probably utterly irrational but PLEASE just answer quickly.
I have been using artificial tears for dry eyes. When I was applying them today, a drop landed on my eyebrow and slid into my eye. 
Is it possible some bacteria got into my eye? Or could it be harmless?
Please, I am stressed out of my mind. I will be grateful for your answers.

TITLE:  Is what do i do next time to make sure i don't offend a tattoo artist ? &amp; did i unknowing say something wrong?
BODY: I got 2 finger tattoos 3 wks ago ,while healing i noticed the lines on the triangle i got,some of the lines were missing .on another i got one was a cover up of a cross i got turned into a arrow and half of arrow head was missing
i went back to see what they could do and instantly the receptionist was like oh you must have been told that was going to happen , which i answered i had not been , ( if i had been told that i wouldn't have bothered getting finger tattoos )  she said they would call me to come in on wednesday . 

i went in on wednesday and talked to the tattoo artist and told him what the issue was politely , and he instantly got defensive and said that his almost positive that he had told me , and i told him that he hadn't as i would have remembered , and i told him that it may have been that he though i already knew because  i had a previous hand tattoo ( i had it covered up by him )  and he said oh iv heard that before  , iv been tattooing for over 20years , i said to him that i didnt mean to offend him . then he walked out the room and hand signaled for me to book a appointment and then walked back in to room and closed the door.

the receptionist was about to book me the appointment then the tattoo artist came back out and pointed at me and said well now im telling you that this will happen , i felt as if i was being bullied  about something i had no control over , i decided in that moment that i wouldn't go through with the touch up there as i felt attacked.

TITLE:  Ruined my hair?
BODY: back when i was in high school a few years ago i bleached my hair and dyed it blue, didn't like is so i dyed it brown in march. In august i dyed it a natural red straight over the brown and then in october bleached it again and dyed it blue/pink. Then around thanksgiving i dyed it brown again and then in february i bleached it again to almost platinum so i could have lilac hair. i then dyed it brown and got it cut into a pixie. I spent like 2.5 years growing out my natural hair to my collarbone from there and now i just bleached my hair on a whim and used blonde box dye over top. I ruined my natural hair, i know there is nothing i can do besides regrow it but it looks bad blonde, should i redye it? should i get it cute short again? i still want long hair but i don't want fake hair/damaged looking hair.

BODY: Hi, I have a pre molar that has split vertically. I'm assuming the split isn't too deep or close to the nerve because i don't have any more pain than usual in the tooth ( I have very sensitive teeth so I have some sort of tooth pain usually).

I really don't want to get it removed. I'm under 18 so I get my dental treatments paid by the nhs, ive heard that some cases of this they can put a crown on the tooth or if they do pull the tooth they can give you a bridge to replace it. Would the nhs pay for me to have any of these done? Thank you

TITLE:  BRACES PAIN! please help!?
BODY: Hi! So I've had braces on for about 1 year and 3 months maybe. Well I just got my braces tightened yesterday. Usually its just a little sore and doesnt bother me too much. Well this time they decided to put a chain on my upper and lower teeth from left to right. So basically, I have a chain the goes across my entire mouth, on all of my teeth, on both upper and lower. It hurts sooo bad though. I went to bed at like 1 or 1:30, which is a little early for me, but I was in too much pain to stay awake last night. Well, since I was in so much pain, I woke up at like 5:30. The pain in unbearable right now. Since I have woken up, I have constantly been sucking on ice which is reducing the pain, I have no medicine, I cant get any, and my mom is getting it while she is at work and wont be home till 4:30 or 5. I am going on a cruise in just a few days, I really dont want to be in pain while I am on the cruise. I know this is long, and I am truely sorry, but can someone just tell me what I can do until I get medicine. And please no hate comments. Thanks! :)

TITLE:  Suffering double-vision this morning - any thoughts?
BODY: Since waking up today (going on 3 hours now) I have had very slight, but noticeable (and annoying) double-vision.  I work as a computer programmer and this is making typing especially hard.

I haven't had a drink in nearly two weeks.  (So, no, I don't have a hangover.)  This has happened in the past, but it usually clears in 5 or 10 minutes.

I find it is my right eye.  If I close the right, I see fine out my left.  If I close my left, I have the double vision with my right only.

How can you have double-vision with one eye closed / looking out only one eye?

TITLE:  Question About Hair Dye/ Hair Color Booster!! Help immediately please?
BODY: So I recently purchased a Clairol Professional Hair Dye (Hot Red) and once i purchased it I looked on the side of the box and saw that it didn't include a hair booster. Since this is my first time dying my hair I don't really know if a hair booster is needed. But a friend of mine told me that since i have dark dark brown hair a color booster is necessary. So she picked up a 7th stage lightener packet and said that i could use that as a booster. After I did a little research on how to use 7th stage I found out that I have to mix it with something thats 20vol or whatever. But here is what my friend said do "mix the 7th stage in with the color creme activator and the base color stuff" so she's Bascially saying use the 7th stage as if it came in the hair dye box as a booster. My question is .. Is this okay to do? Can i just mix the 7th stage in with the stuff that came in the hair dye box or do i have to purchase a 20vol developer to mix the 7th stage with... Thanks in advance!!

TITLE:  Post ACL surgery question!!!?
BODY: So I'm 8 days post op and recovery has been quite a challenge. Not too bad tho. However, I have a cryo cuff water cooler that is underneath all of the ace bandaging. It seems as tho it moved down further on my knee! And I rarely feel the coolness besides the first minute it is on. I feel like it may have moved and is causing me discomfort. I feel as tho the incision on the inside of my knee is kinda burning/stinging and isn't covered by the cooling pack anymore. I want to take the bandaging off so bad to see if everything's ok but I can't for 2 more days until my doctors appt. I'm not allowed to take it off until then so should I just wait it out? I cannot get comfortable

TITLE:  "Hair Gloss Issue" ??? What?
BODY: I got my hair done yesterday and asked for icy/ashy blonde. It came out very yellow ( which is pretty much the COMPLETE opposite of what I wanted). I called to see if it could be fixed and the guy said it is probably just a "glossing issue" and they would just gloss me hair again. They glossed it right after they colored my hair and it's still yellow, why would another gloss make it any different? I don't want my hair glossy, I want the yellow OUT. Is "glossing" just a temporary fix?

BODY: My BD is a little over a year old, I've had him for a year as well. I tried handling him when he was a juvenile ( when I first got him ) and he would squirm around in my hands. It wasn't until he started to grow bigger that it got more and more difficult due to his nails growing sharper and him getting stronger. I really want to tame him down more and get him use to being handled but every time I pick him up he scratches my hands up like crazy!  He's not aggressive and has never tried to bite me or anyone else who has tried handling him. I think it just makes him nervous to be out of his cage, any ideas on what I can do?

BODY: My mom got a spider bite on her arm which resulted in a big bruise. She has a garden and she stuck her hand through a hole in the gardens gate to get something and when she pulled her hand out she said it hurt really bad and when she looked the bruise was gone and where her bruise there was like raw skin like she ripped it off. She put noesporn on it with a band aid and two days later I came out and she said her whole forearm (which is where the bruise was located) hurts really really bad. She thinks the area could've gotten infected. Also when she read the noesporn bottle it said do not apply in open wounds or animal bites. So is it normal for her whole forearm to hurt? Could it be infected from the noesporn and should we go to an ER.

TITLE:  Extremely bloated female adult cat?
BODY: There has been this stray female cat wandering around our factory for about a month. She is harmless, and deaf. We thought she was pregnant but we are thinking differently now. She is extremely bloated and very wide. She eats her food we put out for her and drinks the water. She will walk for a few feet and then lay down and rest. She doesn t seem to be in pain or uncomfortable but we all know that something is not right.

Due to her being a stray cat no one wants to put money into her and take her to the vet. There is no animal control or shelters in that county to call. Due to the overpopulation of the humane society and shelters in other counties there is a fee to take her there, that yet no one wants to pay. We are not inhumane people and we all really do feel for her. The only thing for us to do is to leave her be or tell someone to "take care of her", which no one has the heart to do. 

I m hoping that someone has some suggestion as to why she would be so bloated? We were all thinking maybe worms or digestion problem. I feel so bad for her. Any suggestions?

TITLE:  Connecting a second display wirelessly?
BODY: I have a Dell Inspiron 23 that I need to connect to a second monitor wirelessly. The wireless card (802.11ac + Bluetooth 4.0, Dual Band 2.4&amp;5 GHz, 1x1) is incompatible with Widi and Miracast. Unfortunately, I learned that after purchasing a ScreenBeam Mini 2 which relies on those technologies. I need to know if there's a method (an adapter?) to enable those technologies in an incompatible computer. If not, I need to know if there are alternatives that I can use. I've looked into Chromecast but as I understand it, it's only intended to mirror not act as a second screen. Before anyone says it, for legal reasons I can't use a wired connection here. Thanks for the suggestions in advance!

BODY: Our birds have always refused to tough any flesh surfaces so that means no petting of standing on fingers. Today they got outside for the first time and we didn't notice that they were out there for over an hour when some neighbors called and said our birds were at their window. It turned out that they had flown around for a bit and sat on some neighbors windows and then had flown back and into the house where they were preening in a corner. We have no idea how they got out or back in. We are wondering what to do. We have done some recall training, but we are scared that if they get out a second time they wont get back in. Have any thoughts?

TITLE:  Post ACL surgery?
BODY: ok so I'm 8 days post op and recovery has been quite a challenge. Not too bad tho. I got ACL reconstruction with hamstring graft. However, I have a cryo cuff water cooler that is underneath all of the ace bandaging. It seems as tho it moved down further on my knee! And I rarely feel the coolness besides the first minute it is on. I feel like it may have moved and is causing me discomfort. I feel as tho the incision on the inside of my knee is kinda burning/stinging and isn't covered by the cooling pack anymore. I want to take the bandaging off so bad to see if everything's ok but I can't for 2 more days until my doctors appt. I'm not allowed to take it off until then so should I just wait it out? I cannot get comfortable

TITLE:  Chain cat obsession?
BODY: So, I have a female dwarf cat and a male snowshoe siamese who are just over a year old now, and some weird stuff is going on.

So, i don't know what's happening, but it's like some weird obsession triangle. The snowshoe siamese (Frosty) always follows the dwarf cat (Alice) everywhere. I've seen him lay down with her and basically hug her from behind while she is also laying down. He goes wherever she goes, and it kind of worries me. I think they're too well bonded. Now, Alice... She's for sure obsessed with me. She follows me everywhere, and freaky little Frosty follows her. Anyways, she follows me everywhere, and demands everything from me. She used to be quiet, but she's learned that if she's loud enough, i'll eventually tend to her needs, like opening doors and stuff. She will meow for hours on end if i don't open a door for her (she meows the longest when the door is closed between mw and her). She follows me into the bathroom, and just walks around my legs and looks at me when i'm doing my buisness. every night she comes onto my bed and kneads my belly for HOURS. She, despite being the smallest adult cat in the house, ill pick a fight with basically EVERY cat. But those cats (the other cats, not Alice and Frosty), almost never go upstairs, and i almost never go donstairs, and Alice only seems to pick a fight when i'm downstairs. My mom told me that when Alice HAS to go downstairs without me, she seems scared, afraid. Please help, I don't know what to do about this.

1. What water temperatures can Axolotls live in?
2. Is a 10 gallon tank good for a 4-5 inch Axolotl to live in?
3. My room is normally cold because I "never" take the A/C out of my room and its always on when im getting ready to go to bed. I put a thermometer in the tank and it stays at 25 Celsius. Is that a good temperature? If not, is there any way I can make the tank colder without turning my A/C to below 0 ?

I was going to keep it as a pixie cut but my friend said if I do then I might not get a boyfriend because guys won't like girls with short hair so I should just grow it out.

BODY: I was sitting in the library and I noticed ants in my arm then my hair started itching. I didn't see it in my hair but I believe its in my hair because it was all over the place.

I went immediately home and showered with hot water. But still my hair is itching. I don't think its lice. Can ants stay on hair (like lice) even after showering?

TITLE:  How to remove orange hair color?
BODY: Hi guys,

For the past 5-6 years I've colored my hair bright red. I grew tired of it and decided to just let my hair grow out and not recolor my hair. The results of washing my hair for the past 7-8 months have led to getting this orangeish tone. 

Im wondering what products you guys would recommend for getting my real hair color (brown) back so I can do the blonde ombre look? 

Ps, I'd like to do this at home before going to a salon. 
The current color of my hair is from the picture below. 

Thanks!

TITLE:  New tattoo coverage?
BODY: just got my most recent addition on my leg sleeve on july 3rd, 5 days ago. im at the peeling and itchy phase now (on my calf)

going to a concert on a green tonight, and it is expected to rain and be hot and humid

would you wrap your leg to keep it dry? cling wrap or ace bandage? im going to be wearing shorts and it is general admission, meaning ill be standing infront of stage and sitting back on the green, which will be wet.

or do you think it would be fine getting wet... i just dont want to be ill prepared in the case of a downpour, and most importantly, want to protect my phresh ink and ensure it heals properly

thanks

BODY: Over a month or two ago I fell playing football and my foot started to hurt really bad for the first 3-4 days, it was swollen and bruised. I put some ice on it and the bruise went away, leaving me with a foot a bit swollen which hurts till today. I went to the doctor, he told me to take some ibuprofen which I did, but it only calms my foot, it doesn t take the damage away, still hurts when I walk over 2km. 
It mostly hurts on the upper side, like when walking normally it won t hurt if I don t walk for long, which is what annoys me because I ll be going on a trip soon and there s a lot of walking to do (Trip is in 2 months)

TITLE:  Anti Rootkit?
BODY: I have used roguekiller on my computer for quite a while now and a new tool called "Anti Rootkit" is now available. Some items popped up under the tab after a scan and I clicked delete yet nothing happened. I then tried to download a program called GMER. Every time I downloaded the file a different file name appeared each time which was strange and looked "virusy". Is that how it is supposed to be or is there any other solution to this Rootkit issue I am having?

Thanks

TITLE:  What are the chances of going blind or having serious complications from wearing colored contact lenses regularly?
BODY: I found these very beautiful custom-fitted contact lenses from a company that makes custom contact lenses, so fit won't be a problem. However, I have heard that most colored contact lenses are made from an older type of contact lens material? 

What are the chances of going blind or having severe complications from wearing colored contact lenses made from this older type of material regularly on a normal eye?
 
By "regularly", I mean for about 7 hours per day, 6 days a week? 

Thank you.

TITLE:  Chipped tooth with dental bonding?
BODY: I chipped my bottom front tooth biting my finger nails it chipped off a slice only on the back side of it but the tip was really thinned and a little more down only semi chipped. The top though was probably easy to be broken off and I got dental bonded. Now im wondering what changes have happened to me. Am I not gonna be able to bite things like before with the thinned tip? Like I wont be able to bite heads off of bats like ozzy osborne did meaning my bite is weaker? I liked when my teeth were strong? I feel less of man now. Also, that one tooth was my only weakened tooth since it had a crack running through top from left to right since that was the tooth I bit nails with. Was it bound to be chipped like this anyways somehow even from eating something or was it how hard I bit my long finger nails since in was stressing bad about aomething when biting thwm and how hard I bit nail did it? Or was it just a coincidence it hapoened while stressed and anything could of chipped it? Thanks.

TITLE:  I love dancing but...?
BODY: I know it probably sounds ridiculous but most of my life I've always wanted to do dancing in some form or another. I know I'm probably fit enough and have enough stamina to be a proper dancer as I play (field) hockey which requires a certain level of fitness.

I've never had a lesson and I'm not even good at it. I've tried teaching myself but I find that I lack the motivation to be consistent with my learning so that idea eventually withered like all my other attempts. Getting lessons is out of the question as there is no way parents could afford it and neither could I as I can only start working next year; even then I would need to use the money for other things.

What I really want to do is join/ form a dance group. The idea has always appealed to me as I can do what I love with people who also love it and who would be able to help motivate me and keep me from just giving up but I know I won't be able to. I'm way to shy to ask anyone to join; I don't even know anyone who would join and at my current skill level the group is sure to fail.

As for joining a dance group, frankly, I don't know any to join and once again I'm too shy and would feel like an outsider compared to the people already in the group who would no doubt already know how to dance. 

I just wish to ask anyone for any advice they have, thank you in advance.

BODY: I want to grow my hair out this summer so it's longer for school. 
1) I don't use heat at all. 
2) I braid my hair at night. 
3) My hair is average. Not too think or thin. 
4) My hair grows slow genetically. 
5) I wash it every other day to every 3 days. 
What else can I do? NONE of this is working.

BODY: I am trying to decrease how public my life is, especially because of future employers and such. I really want my facebook to only be seen by my friends. I have changed my username, and my name on facebook. but when I type my name in the search bar, it still comes up.

The only reason I can think this happens is because it shows that I am related to other people with the same last name.... or because I have had my real name on facebook so long. is there anything I can do to stop this?

My hair is brown, thick, doesn't curl, and is short. I'd like to keep it short but full. No thin cuts or anything like that. I don't care how much product it takes I just want something new and stylish. My personality is laid back and I'm a big music guy. A bit of a hipster too. Any suggestions?

TITLE:  Should I re-home my cat?
BODY: I have two cats. Trying to decide if re-homing one of them is a good decision. Details:

1. Male cat &amp; female cat (both fixed, 6 yrs old, have been together since 2 months old) haven't been getting along for the past 4-5 yrs. Its gotten a lot worse &amp; has gotten to the point where I've needed to separate them (my bro has my male cat right now). Male cat constantly attacks female cat. Not sure if it's a personality thing, but the older they got the less they liked each other. Male cat is outgoing, female is timid/shy. 

2. I moved in w/friends a yr ago &amp; ever since they've had issues w/my cats. They love them, but don't like the hair/litter. Male cat likes being around ppl. so his hair &amp; litter gets everywhere. I cleaned twice/day, which helped. Roommates constantly complained &amp; then asked to keep cats in my room. They've also said they'd be ok having both cats if lived in a bigger place (though I doubt it since hair &amp; litter would still get everywhere). Recently I asked them what they though &amp; they said I should get rid of my male cat because of the fighting between the two cats.

My family have also said I should re-home my male cat. I don't want to because I love him so much. However, I don't want to keep him out of selfishness. I want what's best for both cats. That's why I'm asking on here (I want an outsiders opinion). What do you think would be best for my cats? In case it matters, I got my female cat first. Thank you for your help.

I don't want to block them as they are family and I don't want to make my profile private as this won't make a difference as they are already following me so they will still see what I've liked. 

Facebook have a privacy setting for this right? Shouldn't we able to do this on IG too? I don't think i'll be using it till they improve privacy settings.

TITLE:  Betta fish is listing to one side and smashing into sides of tank/darting about?
BODY: My mother's betta fish has massive fin rot which she did not notice (he was leaning on the housing for the filter because he could not swim in the current).  He has been at my house in a hospital tank for 9 days, and finished his 7-day treatment Sunday night.  I did a complete water change and he has been acting strangely the past 2 days.  He is darting around, running into the sides of the tank, listing to one side and is not eating as much.  His fins are still re-growing so I don't think he can be returned to a tank with a filter yet.  He is not constipated, his abdomen is not distended, but he sits for long periods of time in a strange position then darts around.  He does not always list to one side, it is random.

It was when I woke up that I realized I had not eaten anything since waking up, as it was 4pm. Would this be typical for someone who hasn't eaten, or would this be a sign of Hypoglycemia?

TITLE:  Should the doctor have at least x-rayed my finger?
BODY: So my finger has been sore at the knuckle for about a months time. After hoping it would just go away I decided to make a doctors appointment. the knuckle at the pointer finger hurts when I stretch  my hand out and is in general sore throughout the day ay sporadic times. I am only 46 and don't think it is arthritis and the doctor more or less just blew me off when I said it might be that. I also thought it might be broken but the doctor said you would be in a lot of pain. He did not even x-ray it. It kinda makes a snapping noise when I stretch it out.  I noticed too that the blood vessels that are close to that finger are bigger that the ones on the other hand. don't know if that has anything to do with it. thanks

TITLE:  Are Any of These Good Gaming PCs?
BODY: I really only ever play Minecraft, Left 4 Dead 2, Planetside 2, and TERA. I've been doing so on a laptop so far, but (other than Minecraft packs under 200 mods) those games are pretty CPU intensive and tend to overheat my laptop rather quickly, even with my cooling pad, or drain my battery too quickly. I've decided on a max price of 500 dollars including upgrades, since my friend is willing to sell me his gaming desktop for that much (32gbram, 6core RFX290 FAT2 chip set, 6 fan cooling system, 500gb hard drive, 280 watt power supply).
I like these for the prices, especially the Lazer, but I would be buying 8+ gb RAM the moment I get it. Are any of these good gaming PCs, just for what I'm playing? And are any of these companies really reliable? Most of the bad reviews are responded to and corrected, but the ones that aren't are absolutely unacceptable, like broken parts or having no OS.

TITLE:  What kind of make up should I use?
BODY: I'm not looking for too much because I'm not into the "covered up" look

but I haven't figured out what colors are good for my face,and how much eyeliner (because I always fail at how much to put on, so I never bother, it just looks strange) , and how much this and that. 

I don't want to look like a 12 year old trying too hard though.. because as you can see i have a childish face and people have mistaken my real age many times. (and no, I am not 12-16) I'm older than that.

I want to enhance my features not cover them.. but I have no idea how that works.

BODY: I got a silver tooth when I was about 7, I am now 13. I was eating Mike and Ikes, and I felt something hard when I was chewing. MY SILVER TOOTH HAD COME OFF. Apparently my tooth was cracked, because a piece of it came off with the silver cap. I can now see the tooth they covered. It's decaying and I can see the inside. What can I do? I called my dad and he said he'll take me to the dentist soon. I have been brushing my teeth twice a day, and flossing once a day. I don't understand why the rest of my teeth are white but this one is decaying.

TITLE:  How can I get rid of a stray cat?
BODY: There is a stray cat that has been hanging around my backyard for a while now. She is loaded with fleas and doesn't let me go near her. She has 3 kittens with her and they look to be about 2-3 months old and they also have fleas. But I also have two stray cats that I've been feeding for years. They are both nice enough for me to pet them and hold them so I got them fixed last year. They had no fleas until this other stray cat starting hanging around. I don't want her here because she's passing on her fleas to the other two cats I've been feeding and I fear she'll continue giving birth around my house and bring more cats. I've tried catching her months but I fail every time. I want to bring the other two strays inside my house and feed them in here, but I have a house cat and I don't want him to get fleas and he might fight with them. The stray cat with the kittens is very skinny and looks malnourished but I just don't want her here. I feel bad for the kittens but they'll most likely keep reproducing and I don't want my house to be a place full of cats. What can I do to get rid of her? Should I only put out enough food for two strays I've had for years so maybe the cat and her kittens will go away?

Computer has been running hot, but I've been careful with it. Once I give it maybe 15 minutes on a cool down, it will once again load into BIOS/OS.

Any ideas?

TITLE:  What do I do with this baby mouse I found?
BODY: My dog brought in a baby mouse, really young considering its eyes haven't opened yet. We've been having a mouse problem lately and have been using an electronic trap to kill them, but I can't bring myself to kill a little baby mouse. I can't put it back in the yard either because we probably killed the mom so it would die, and if by the slim chance it survives it would just make our mouse problem bigger. I don't want to set it free somewhere else because it would certainly die, but I don't really want to keep it either. It s a wild mouse so it probably has diseases, and I'm moving away in a few weeks and wouldn't be able to bring it with me. What do I do with it?

TITLE:  How to introduce my new pet rat to another?
BODY: I just bought Emma yesterday. She seems to be very young (only about three or four inches, not including her tail). She's still getting used to me and whatnot, but she's done a good job of climbing around her cage and chewing on the paper towel roll I put in there. She seems content. Nervous, and scared, as I suspect are normal. But content as far as her cage goes. I'd only planned on buying one because my landlord is very peculiar about pets, but I've read so much about them that I can't NOT get her a companion. I know she will be much happier that way. My problem: when I went to buy her yesterday, another person was there buying some too (except she was getting them for her snake). There were only three in the cage, and I picked Emma out before they could send her off to her demise. I assume this means that she was the last of that particular litter. If I go back today, or a week from now, the rats I see won't be the ones she knows. Because she's so young, and new to me as well, what is the best way to introduce the two? Would Emma welcome the other rat as company or do I have to slowly introduce them? Thank you.

BODY: I felt hard and it was sensitive to touch it. I have an appointment next week because my Dr is on vacation. The swelling went down over night, but I'm still a little more sore than usual. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this or something similar? I have NO clue what it could be, at all. Thanks!

TITLE:  How does adsense work?
BODY: I basically thought about using adsense but I'm confused on how it works. These are the two ways that I think it would work but which one is right (or if neither please explain). The scenario is that someone has a blog/website about sewing and details of sewing:
-Is it that they place an ad with adsense in their blog/website? Then when people click on it, does the ad take you to like that same person's sewing service? So that you can like request a dress sewn or whatever?
-Or is it that someone google searches how to sew. Then they click on one of the websites. And because the ad is about sewing, it would show up on that website. Then when you click on it, it takes you to the blog/website of sewing and people read that?
I am just so confused on how it works. Please help.

TITLE:  Is it possible me and my daughter may have been exposed to rabies!!?? Please help!!! Freaking out!!?
BODY: Our outside cat always fights with other cats and raccoons. 2 days ago we saw a random dead raccoon in our yard with no injuries which leads me to believe it was from rabies. That same day our cat bit me and my daughter. She never acts like that. Yesterday and today the cats been acting completely normal again. A bird ate and carried away the raccoon mostly. Our cat is being nice and eating but I'm not letting my child near her until I observe her for 10 days. After these 10 days are up im getting rid of her. She's just an outside cat we feed and im not going to risk this crap. Is it possible we may have gotten rabies from the cat? Can they be contagious before they show any symptoms? Since its been 2 days, would she be really sick by now? We live in Ohio. There's not MANY rabid raccoons or cats at all. I'm just scared because the cat plays with raccoons a lot since we've been feeding her this last month. Please ease my mind. I'm deathly scared. I'm not even sure if my mind will be eased when this 10 day observation is over:/

BODY: I had sports day today and I was in the middle of playing hockey and one of the other teams players hit my ankle with their stick really hard then pushed the stick into the top of my foot (on purpose but that's not really the point).This caused me to start limping and I couldn't run on it and it hurts to put weight on it. Then later I tripped on a step and landed on the Side of my ankle. When I got home it and finally got to remove my trainers my ankle was swollen and I have bruises on my ankle and foot. When I move it upwards or to feather side it hurts and also when I walk on it. Sorry if it sounds like I'm being a drama queen but it really hurts. Thanks x

America was won in battle.

Whites then founded the USA in 1776 ON LANDS OWNED BY WHITES.

USA = White settler land.

In 1776, all of western north america that was not colonized by whites yet was therefore NOT PART OF THE USA.

It wasnt untl whites conquered thos lands that they became part of the USA.


USA is in principle White Territory.

TITLE:  How do I make my cat stop meowing?
BODY: Male cat. Fixed. 1 1/2 year old. Had him when he was a kitten.

He meows constantly now. He always meowed a little when he was a kitten and now it's just constant. He always has food and water and clean litter and plenty toys to play with.

Meows when I'm awake or asleep. No matter how much attention I give him, he meows. When I try to leave him be, he meows. He's in great health and shows no issues, but he still meows.

It's hard enough on me, but it's even harder on my roommates. They're starting to dislike him and get frustrated with me over him as well. What am I gonna do??? I don't wanna just give him away. He may be really annoying now, but he's still my baby

Can anyone help me? I really don't know what to think at this point.

TITLE:  Why is my Betta building his bubble nest so wierd?!?!?
BODY: Hello! My betta recently started building his bubble nest 2 days ago. It is still somewhat tiny. I have a couple questions. 1) How much longer is it going to take until the bubble nest is finished and they embrace? ) The nest is very unusually built. There is one spot where most of his bubbles go and it is behind the filter. (don't worry the filter is off while he is building) and there are random clusters of bubbles on the surface as well. That leads to my second question 2) Is this unusual for the bubble nest to be scattered around like that? 3) Do you think he is taking longer to build it than normal? Please help! Thanks

BODY: My family moved in to a house about 2 years ago. We always saw this cat during the day, just walking around the neighborhood. He didnt have a collar. We knew him as the cat that just visits everyone. We knew he had a home because he looked healthy and clean. Wven more so, he was a chubby cat. Recently, he started getting skinny. We've seen him more often. He's usually scared of us, and doesn't let us get closer. I don't know what happened! He's very small now and we see him on the sidewalks instead of the backyards.

TITLE:  PLEASE HELP! could we get rabies? Bit 2 days ago, cats acting normal. Dead raccoon. Is it possible? I'm freaking out!cat fights with coons?
BODY: Our outside cat always fights with other cats and raccoons. 2 days ago we saw a random dead raccoon in our yard with no injuries which leads me to believe it was from rabies. That same day our cat bit me and my daughter. She never acts like that. Yesterday and today the cats been acting completely normal again. A bird ate and carried away the raccoon mostly. Our cat is being nice and eating but I'm not letting my child near her until I observe her for 10 days. After these 10 days are up im getting rid of her. She's just an outside cat we feed and im not going to risk this crap. Is it possible we may have gotten rabies from the cat? Can they be contagious before they show any symptoms? Since its been 2 days, would she be really sick by now? We live in Ohio. There's not MANY rabid raccoons or cats at all. I'm just scared because the cat plays with raccoons a lot since we've been feeding her this last month. Please ease my mind. I'm deathly scared. I'm not even sure if my mind will be eased when this 10 day observation is over:/

We had him get his shots. I haven't seen a change in him, but since he was outside all the time/ sharing a garage with other cats, he may have rabies!!! Could he be infecting me, my family, other pets?? I have a puppy that hasn't had his rabies shots yet.

TITLE:  Why does my thumb feel weird from playing cello?
BODY: Hello I am16 yrs old and have been playing cello for about 6 years now. I've taken lessons for about three years. When I first began playing I had a terrible bow hold which caused a lot of pain in my right hand. I've used the same bow hold for maybe the first three years which really affected my hand. After I fixed my hold, I tended to squeeze my thumb a lot when playing, because it feels like the bow will fall out if i don't. Because of the squeezing (I think) my thumb cracks when I sometimes when I bend it and also my right thumb feels very strange. It feels kinda weak and unresponsive. Also I see that when I bow or even just daily activities with my hands, my thumb and sometimes the whole hand tends to shake and tremble which makes things hard. When I bow it sounds like I'm doing a little tremelo due to this shaking. Is there any way to fix this or something like that? Thanks! (calling out to all cello players)

TITLE:  Have you heard of The Holocaust?
BODY: It's the most beautiful story ever to be told. Allow me to tell the short version. The Jews infiltrated Germany, took over the banks, and stole the wealth of The German people. The international Jewry made events possible that led to The First World War. The Germans fought bravely, however, The Jewish puppet leaders of Germany surrendered to the race traitor British an French forces. The Jews blamed Germany for the war, and the Germans suffered. As the German people suffered, the hook nosed Jews prospered. Despite living in Germany, the Jews looked down on Germans. Germany was the underdog, until the Germans were left with but two choices - Fight, or die, and the Germans fought. The self loathing whites attacked the Germans yet again. After many battles, Germany lay defeated, but they took six million parasites with them, who's families to this day, fear the day when the mighty Aryans rise once more, to bring to a conclusion, a Final Solution.

BODY: I stepped on a thumbtack yesterday that got in my shoe. It went through the heel of my foot and I pulled it out with little pain. I don't know if it bled or not since I was a hurry to get where I was going and only stopped when I felt the sharp pain in my foot and discovered the thumbtack.
When I got home I washed my feet and everything seemed fine. Woke up today and my whole leg up to my knees are stiff. Not sure if it's due to the incident yesterday or not.

BODY: I got a Labial Frenectomy on Tuesday last week (that's where they remove the flap of skin that connects your top lip to your gums), and it's now almost Thursday, so about 9 days ago. My boyfriend has been gone on vacation for 3 weeks now and he comes back this weekend. I have the dissolvable stitches in, but it's still a bit challenging for me to smile full-range and what not (it feels tight and a little sore). I was wondering if I would be healed in time 100% for this weekend, so I'd be able to kiss him? Thanks in advance for the help! :)

TITLE:  Fish Tank Help Needed!?
BODY: I am wanting to get my own little aquarium to put on my nightstand. I do not want to have a bowl over 10 gallons and cannot afford a heater. I can afford a simple filter but only if necessary. I only want two fish to be in the tank, one green and one pink (Yes there names will be Cosmo and Wanda). I went to the store and the only fish these colors were Glo-fish. I read about their counterparts, Zebra Fish. It said they should be in groups of 5 or more in an aquarium but it did not clarify if this requirement was for them being by themselves or if they were with other species. Can I only have two glo-fish in the bowl without there being an issue and would a filter be required? 
Thanks for any help.

BODY: my husband and I are expecting our first child, he has crystal blue eyes and my eyes are blue with gold flakes around the pupils and a brown spot above the pupil on my left eye, i have a condition that causes the spots without there something being medically wrong. So my question is what color will or could the baby's eyes be if my eyes are liked I described and his are blue? I ask because I remember my biology teacher telling the class that two brown eyed people  can have a blue eyed chiled but two blue eyed people can not have a brown eyed chiled and was wondering if my eye condition could play a part in the baby's eye color or if it would have blue eyes.

TITLE:  Were can i buy good cosplay human hair wigs?
BODY: I bought a wig at an anime expo and its really good it dosent fall off n dosent feel heavy at all and stays on good. The expo its over now so i want to buy more cosplay wigs with real human hair so when i brush it, it will brush good and feel soft. Because the wig i bought its not real hair so when i brush it the hair kinda falls off. But other then that the wig is really good. Do they have those at a store or online?  I prefer store so i can see. Also do u wash wigs?  And how?

TITLE:  Hair dye help?
BODY: I'm dyeing my hair and really like this blue. My hair is currently a natural strawberry blonde colour, and I'm wondering if I would have to bleach it for the colour to turn out right, or at least look similar to the colour in the picture. 
I am also wondering what dye(s) would help me get to a colour close to the colour shown in the picture? Brand names and the name of the colour(s) would be amazing. 

Thanks (:

TITLE:  Horses destroying pastures?
BODY: I have had horses for over ten years and this year we decided to give up some of our lawn and put a fence around it to make more pasture room because the other 2 pastures will not grow back.  This new pasture we made this year has been planted for over 10 years so the grass should be well rooted and it has always grown very well before but now it no longer grows since the horses have been on it.  
What can I do to get my pasture to grow back?  I've thought about replanting a pasture and keeping horses off of it for a few seasons but I am afraid the same thing will happen.

She loves the smell of them...I'm talking the ones in red wine vinegar as well as the green Spanish olives..shouldn't the strong vinegar smell turn her off of them?

TITLE:  Is my kitten sick or depressed?
BODY: So lately me and my family (there's 4 of us) have been leaving on the weekends and what not and have left our 4 month old kitten there. We send the neighbor over to feed him and last time we took him to my grandparents for a few days. Today we left for Ocean City and I noticed he realized that we were packing up and leaving. I gave him his food as we were starting to leave and he wouldn't eat it. The neighbor stopped by today and said he hadn't eaten or drank and still won't. I don't know if he's upset we have left or if he is sick. I mean any ideas or suggestions would be nice I am a little concerned about him.

TITLE:  Should my cat watch The Lion King?
BODY: I have a pet calico cat, Molly. 

I LOVE the Lion King, and I was feeling kind of bad because my cat has never seen it.  I wonder if she would like it, because Simba is kind of a giant, wild, cat.  I'm not sure if she's mature enough, though, and parts of it might be too scary/sad for her.  

She's watched "Frozen" and "Tangled" but didn't really get into them, but I think Lion King is MUCH better.

Should I get it for my cat?  Would she enjoy watching it?

TITLE:  Besides the Clippers, do you see any other team beating the Spurs in the first round?
BODY: I can see the Warriors or Grizzlies giving them trouble, but not sure about beating them. People would say the Mavericks but they almost got swept by the Rockets and the Spurs destroyed the last 2 games of the season vs the Rockets. The Blazers would not stand a chance same with the Pelicans. The Grizzlies can actually give them a run for their money. Z-Bo and Gasol could take over the paint in a series, not sure about the outcome though.

TBH not sure if any team in the West including the Warriors would put much effort as the Clippers did against the Spurs.


BQ: Someone said it here best yesterday. Do you agree if the Clippers played the way they did against the Spurs they can pretty much beat anyone in the West? Including the Warriors, and could they have beaten a healthy Cavs in the finals?

During the night we turn off the infrared light and keep the heating mat on. We also cover the top with a towel so not much heat escapes during night. Is that okay? Are the temperatures okay? How much does a good thermostat usually cost and would you recommend a probe thermometer or just a regular  thermometer and hydrometer? Also she is very active at night so I think thats a good sign.

He hasn't moved much from one spot in his cage and when I took him out on the floor, he didn't walk much and he is limping. It's his back left leg if you're looking at him from his front. I know I need to trim his nails, but he's never gotten like this. His foot itself has no sores or anything on it. What should I do (not willing to pay for a vet, my mom already said no to any guinea pig pet problems since they live for only a few years)? I've had him since he was a baby.

TITLE:  Best ways to repaired dry and damaged hair?
BODY: 5 or 7 months ago I had very dark brown hair, I decided that I wanted to slowly go blonde so I dyed that brown to a dark red, the red faded then it went to a lighter brown, then we used a dye remover hair color to lighten it blablabla and basically we used allot of chemicals and dye on my hair and bleached it 5 times over the course or 4 - 3 times and recently I just bleached it again an toned it twice all in the span of 3 days and it is now dried and pretty damaged so I was wondering what are the best ways to repair my hair? It's only down to my shoulders maybe a bit above, it's pretty short.

Thanks

TITLE:  What's an easy way to tell if your mare is in season?
BODY: I plan on breeding my mare Willow in spring next year. We have a gelding here who my mare is in love with and she tends to go crazy for him when in season. He wont be here much longer though, he's leaving in August to go to Arizona because he's actually my friends horse and they're moving. All we have is mares here. I have a friend who has a stallion but that stallion doesn't know the actual stallion life and I'd hate to just tease him especially just to see if my mare is in season. Is there any way I'll really be able to make sure my mare is in season without having to use a stallion as a tease?

My orthodontist says that is still good but he thinks i should replaced them.  I feel pressure as i dont want my teeth go bad again but 200 bucks for the plastic piece seems over price, what about if it breaks again.

When I sit down, he rubs all over me and he LOVES to be petted and scratched. But sometimes he bites me? It's not aggressive at all, it's just he sniffs my fingers then bites them. When I pull my hand away and say no, he just batts my hand with his claws. What is he doing? Is he just trying to play? Maybe curious? Does he know he's hurting me?

TITLE:  What is wrong with my tooth??
BODY: I've been to the dentist 5 times now, at first he thought my pain was from needing wisdom teeth romoved, did that, pain persisted. Both me and my dentist thought the pain I was still feeling was left over from the wisdom teeth extraction. Its been a MONTH now since my wisdom teeth were pulled and about 3 since pain started. 

The pain is in one area, with extreme hot and cold sensitivity, it also starts to really hurt if I chew anything on that side. If I completely leave it alone I'm usually ok but I still always get a dull throbbing pain in that area.

Dentist did a lot of tests, xrays all show up normal, did a cold touch test where he put something extremely cold on each tooth and said I reacted normally.

I had a gum abscess show up in the trouble area that quickly popped and drained, he gave me antibiotics for that, now about three weeks later and still feeling pain.

This is driving me CRAZY!!! should I get a second opinion? What the heck is going on??

TITLE:  Should I keep my teeth?
BODY: I repeated this question, because I need as many opinions as I can get.


When I first got my braces on in November 2013, I had an overbite, and my orthodontist considered a surgery for me to get it fixed, but my mother didn't want me to have the surgery. So instead, I was supposed to have braces for 2 years. 
 Recently, my orthodontist mentioned my overbite wasn't as bad as it was before, but he also mentioned that there was an opportunity for me to get 4 teeth removed. If I got those 4 teeth removed my overbite wouldn't be as bad. But, I ha to have braces for another year or so. This made me a little upset, because I was already anxious to get my braces off and the thought of keeping them on for another year really bothers me. I also really want to get my overbite fixed because I hate my overbite, it makes me insecure and it bothers me so much. I just have no idea what to do. Help?

TITLE:  How do I get my guinea pig to like me?
BODY: I've tried hand feeding her, spending a lot of time with her, allowing her to be out of her cage yet she still seems scared and unhappy. She runs away from me whenever I try to pick her up and makes this "wheeking" noise while I'm holding her. I just don't know what to do. Any advice?

TITLE:  Do you have to do an identity check on Facebook if you have the login security settings turned off when logging in from another location?
BODY: I probably asked this before but was not specific. I have my login alerts and login approvals turned off. My three friends and I are going to move from TX to NC in next month. All of them and I use my computer to log in to Facebook. My friends login with their own accounts. They have their login alerts and login approvals turned off as well. So, if we login to Facebook from a location hundreds of miles away with the login security settings turned off, do you have to do an identity check?

TITLE:  I'm 14 and I would like to build a gaming PC but my father won't let me. How do I convince him otherwise?
BODY: I have spent months on finding the right parts to my setup and I have all of them on a saved wishlist on Amazon. In a year or two I will be able to get a job and earn some extra money. Along with saving for a car and college, I hope to use some of the money to build a $1000 gaming PC. This I will hope to use all throughout High School and maybe a little in College if it lasts for both school and gaming. My mom thinks its a solid plan and wished me luck but my Dad doesn't agree. He is always telling me about how he was irresponsible as a young adult and wanting to buy things like the VCR and Pager, ended up buying, and how they are obsolete. His fear is that I will be like him and want to spend every dollar that I earn but that just isn't the case. I completely understand that he is just looking out for me but this is what is holding me back. I have good grades and my chores are most always done so how could I change his mind? ANY help that you are willing to give is very much appreciated.

BODY: I'm a lyrical dancer and looking for songs about being single becuase that's the only thing I can relate too. I've never been in love/heart broken, bullied, or have a family member pass. So being single while all my friends are in relationships is the only thing j can relate too. Are there any lyrical songs like this? Probably not because everything now adays is about love so YA. 
Thanks!

TITLE:  How to tell if my disability is due to bone structure or a muscular rotation lost after injury?
BODY: Hi! I have an problem with my right fore arm, I can't flip it over with my palm to the sky. The furthest I can flip it over is 90 degrees and not the full 180. I have broken this arm a total of 4 times, every time in the forearm area. Two of the times I had a displaced fracture and the doctors tried to reset them in office but both times they failed so I had to have surgery anyways. I have lost over half the rotation in my right forearm. I simply can not do some exercises and my coach is very frustrated. I have done many streches to try to regain my rotation over the years. I have gain a little more rotation but not enough to make a real difference. I just want to know if there is a way that I can tell if my lack of rotation is due to my bone structure or if it is muscular and if so can I fix it? I would prefer a way to know without a doctor due to financial issues and I would greatly appreciate any information about the human forearm. Thanks guys I great appreciate the help!

TITLE:  Elbow pain only in the pitching motion. Causes?
BODY: So recently I ve been having really bad pain in my elbow ONLY when I throw (pitch or just warming up). Even when playing soft toss to warm up it hurts like hell. It is on the inside of my elbow mostly on my bicep end. When I say only when I throw, I mean after the inning or even 10 seconds after I throw, the pain is COMPLETELY gone until I pitch/throw again. Like when I leave the game it isn t swollen and I m not in pain at all. It is ONLY going through the throwing motion. This has been going on for 5 years now but the last 2 years it has gotten really bad ever since I started pitching on the high school team. 

Seeing a doctor likely isn t going to happen right away since my family doesn t have health insurance. That being said, I am relying on self diagnoses as a first resort and will see a doctor if that fails. Also worth mentioning I broke my elbow when I was 10 and I think that has something to with this. I doubt it s nerve damage or pinched nerve because the pain is for a short duration and I experience no numbness or tingling. Tendonitis is possible, but that would mean I ve had tendonitis for 5 years and I would probably be in constant pain from permanent damage. Plus even after 3 months of rest in the off season, the first time I warm up 3 months later my arm hurts right away. Basically I m looking for causes and not necessarily ways to fix it.

TITLE:  Can I edit semi pro level videos with integrated GPU (mac 21.5) ?
BODY: I've spent forever looking for a Mac that I can afford and has what I need. The one I'm looking at is the 21.5 Mac, I will upgrade to the 2.7 quad core processor, 16gb ram, and 256 flash storage. 
It does not have a separate graphics card, but has integrated Intel iris pro graphics. Will this be a problem for video editing with final cut? I will bump up the ram but I heard that is not needed and it won't help. I heard I will need a dedicated graphics card for editing. Thanks a lot!

But someone told me it could've been because i wore hats alot in highschool, if that's the case does it grow back to normal if i stop wearing them?

TITLE:  Pain in corner of eye?
BODY: This has lasted about 3 days now. It began after i got something in my eye when going to bed and i attempted to rub it out but the pain became worse. I felt my eyes trying to flush out whatever was in there. Eventally the pain was less severe but still was slightly painful and i went to sleep. Ever since my eye (whenever i blink) has been in pretty bad pain. Ive tried wearing an eye patch to stop the pain b/c it only occurs if i blink. The eyelid is not tender or red (though there is 1 red vein stringing from the point of pain) i also verified that there isnt a bump in my eyelid or anything (so if you say its a sty you probably didnt read the whole post). Also my vision isnt affected. My eye is also very dry and i used eye drops to remedy that but it did not ease the pain. Is my eye damaged or something?

I got it done 3 days ago and have been putting bapanthen on it and washing it twice a day and patting it dry but I noticed today it looks like the ink has bled making it look blurry. Is this a normal part of the healing process? Will that blurryness go away? This is my first tattoo so I don t know what to expect.

Thanks.

TITLE:  Will I tell secrets after wisdom teeth removal?
BODY: I'm going in to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth out before they come in (cramped jaw) and I'm worried the drugs will effect me badly. A few months ago I apparently had wayyyyyyy to much to drink (first time with hard A) and was hazed to the point where I was taken to the hospital and was apparently "suicidal." I don[t have these feeling on a normal basis or even irregular but now that it's happened once I'm afraid that drugs will make it happen again. My parents know obviously and I've told them I'm not suicidal but they might not believe it if I say something after surgery.

Will I be out of it and possibly say something like "Oh yea, sometimes" because I few years ago I used to be mildly depressed. But not really, only situationally which I don't think counts. How do I help this? I'm super nervous!

My bite is too, the orthodontist even told me so, but the only thing keeping me from getting them off is 12 year molars which haven't completely grown in yet (even though I'm 15) and according to the x-ray he did last time, they're growing in very crooked. I don't know if I can deal with having them much longer, what should I do?

TITLE:  How to tame slightly older, store-bought male rat?
BODY: Hello, my rat is with me around few weeks. He's 2 months from what I've been told, he's furless (more like fuzzy) dumbo and male, as said.

He is completely used to his cage, also it's surrounding and my hand...sadly I can not buy him a rat friend, but I want to spend my whole day around him...he does not.

Except his sleepy mood (ateast around day, I don't know what he is doing at night...probably sleeping aswell) he doesn't like being with me/around me.
When he hears me, he immediately sprints to cage when he is out. When I put my hand in cage he either stays still or hides.
Also when I get him out of the cage, he tries to escape and hide (+ getting him out of the cage is for sure against his will). As soon as I get him out, he only stays with me if he is too high and he can't jump out of me.

I've tried giving him treats, but he wants none out of his cage and when he is in it...well, he grabs it, hides and waits till everything calms down, sometimes till I leave. I've tried baby food but he won't come out of the cage for it and in cage it's slightly useless.

He's very nice rat except that, what should I do? Maybe I should not give up with treats and repeat for so long till it works? Or do I do something wrong?

Help please ;u;

My first place if the middle upper back but more of a small/medium size.

My second choice is lower outside on one of my calves so its almost on the side of my leg kind of at 4 o'clock. A little on the smaller size

TITLE:  Bleaching ratchet hair, and conquering the brassiness after?
BODY: 've recently bought lightning bleach for my naturally black hair. However, I dyed my hair once and that color is still on my lower half of the hair. The color is brownish-ginger because of the brassiness. I was wondering if I need to bleach my virgin hair more than the already-dyed hair? Or should bleach more my ends?

I'm going for a simple ombre (which is similar to what I have now but the ends a bit lighter). 

And after bleach could I use a hair dye instead of a toner to get rid of the brassiness?

TITLE:  Is blonde hair bad?
BODY: My mother is brunette and my father has dirty blonde hair. I normally consider myself to have brown hair although I had a blonde spot when I was three.

Lately I ve noticed that if I use rather aggressive shampoo my hair become somewhat more lighter and have this yellow-ish hue. Is this a bad sign?

Does it mean I m damaging my hair in any way? 

I have kind of little longer hair and want to keep it clean, but at the same time I m predominantly asian looking and don t enjoy looking like I m perpetually doing a botch job dying my hair.

Can an onlooker of my Facebook see them straight away, or would they have to click the same thing as I do to view them (click highlighted posts then click see all posts)?

TITLE:  Why is my computer boot up so long?
BODY: Okay, so I built myself a new computer, and it runs great for gaming. It takes everything I throw at it with no problem.
But... It has a flaw. A minor one, sure, but a VERY annoying one.
You guessed it from the question, so I'm just wondering...
Why?
I have my OS installed on a 256 GB SSD, and any of my other files on my hard drive.
I also have 8 GB of ram (4x2)
So I don't see WHY it would take so long.
The parts in my computer are very powerful as well.
The ONLY thing I've found that sounds like it'd might work is removing things from SD slots before boot up.
So, what's your suggestion?
Did I plug something in wrong?

TITLE:  My cat is possessive of me?
BODY: I live with 3 other people and this cat seems to love me the most. I have 4 other cats but usually they aren t as clingy. But this one cat, followed my brother home  about 4 years ago and we kept him from then. He s always been very affectionate and loving, talkative, but he hates being held. He sleeps at the end of the bed, or in between my legs, he follows me when I go for walks, he walks me to the car, he walks me to my neighbours house, and if I pat any other cat he will hit them and growl. He also waltzes into my room when I m patting another cat and gets really angry and I try to pat him and he just bites me or hits me in the face. He also pees in my room if he s mad. Lately all the cats have been becoming really jealous of each other and really posessive over  just me. I walk into my room and theres 4 cats on my bed. They all insist on sleeping in my bed too. I have three questions now

1) do you think my cat has abandonment issues? Is that why he s so clingy?
2) why is it mainly me that they cling to?
3) what could be the reason for them all being posessive  of me?

TITLE:  Did I clean this hamster bite correctly?
BODY: So I just got another hamster that I named Bambi from Petsmart. I've had many hamsters but I've never been bitten until today by Bambi. I used warm water and soaped it up with a bar of soap real good, then I let it soak for a bit in the warm water. Did I handle this right? I know some rodent bites can be serious and life threatening (rat-bite fever) and since he is new I don't really know about his health other than immediate observation. Should I do anything else? Btw it wasn't a particularly nasty bite. He bit just enough to break skin and make a bit of blood come out, I imagine he could have done some real damage if he was serious.

TITLE:  Should I do kickboxing?
BODY: I am 5'1" and about 112lbs. I have recently gotten a boxing gym membership, and have learned a lot of basics to boxing. However, with the membership, I am able to attend any class I believe. Should I attend the kickboxing class? The only thing is, is that I do know punches but not kicks and other stuff, would it be that hard to catch on to the class? Also, is there a chance of getting in better shape with kickboxing instead of boxing, since it uses legs and more flexibility in the legs and abs? I want to get in really good shape, and possibly spar(: Also, if someone could help give me a little motivation that would be great too...I have very extreme social anxiety so I don't like going into new things alone without as much experience. I am afraid if I do the kickboxing for the first time, I will not know what they are doing, and if they partner up I will have no partner:( Should I do it or no?

TITLE:  Why is my male chinchilla attaching the female.?
BODY: I have a 9 month old male and i got a female a few days ago. I placed her smaller cage next to his for while and they didn t seem to pay much attention to each other. I let out to run a round where the cages are, it s quite a big space, it s a garage/sleep out. He just kept chasing her and I left them for a few minutes as I was told that was quite normal as he is just trying to breed, this morning I let her in his cage for about an hour then let him back in and he actually bit her and her tale was bleeding. I ve put her in the big cage with my younger girl. And he s in a smaller cage next to then. Do you think I should just give them more time getting use to each other or do I need a new girl. Or is it possible that the boy is a girl and the girl is actually a boy??? 
And yes I do want to breed them and I do have the space and money to care for them.

TITLE:  Who else is annoyed at all the Djokovic fanboys calling him the best?
BODY: Djokovic's good, but, both, Rafa and Fedex in their prime would take him out quite comfortably. He hasn't even won enough grand slams to be even close to the best.  Laver, Agassi, Connors, Mcnroe and a few others were equally good if not better. Some of them were just unlucky to miss out on the grand slams because the competition was stiffer and multiple grand slam winners were a part of the draw almost everytime, especially, in the 80's.
Novak's looking good but I don't think his form's going to hold on for any longer than 1-2 more years. So, fanboys, learn to deal with it.And YES, this is a rant.

TITLE:  Tropical to cold water tank gone cloudy?
BODY: I had a well planted tropical tank with about 15 tropical fish, water conditions read perfect every time it was tested and never had a problem with it
I recently removed the heater (found alternate tanks for the tropical fish) and put in a ranchu gold fish. A few days later, the water appeared cloudy. It hasn't yet been tested and the fish himself looks content, but I've never had a cloudy tank before. What could have caused this?

TITLE:  Will you help me, with my book?
BODY: (This from a part of my book that I am still writing) 
15 days later, I was walking to school, when I saw a boy who looked no older than 10 years old walk into my school. We soon learned that was he was in our 1st period class. He said name was Alucard Dal V. Tepes Et Squartatore.
(Is that the little boy name a dead give away that he is Vlad Dracula the Impaler and Ripper? Tepes is Romanian for The 'Impaler'. Et is Latin for 'and'. Squartatore is Italian for 'Ripper'.)

In the last 5 days there were 10 murders. 5 of which are almost identical to the Jack the Ripper murders except no notes and none of the victims were hookers rather all victims were nuns. At the first murder there was “I am the Ripper of Whitechapel” written on the wall. 

In the other 5 murders, priests were impaled on spears and at the first of these murders “My name is Vlad the Impaler” was written on the wall.

TITLE:  Mom needs computer buying advice lol-help?
BODY: I am trying to buy a PC on a VERY limited budget and this one seems good on ebay-the guy built it himself nearly 4 years ago and seems knowledgeable when I asked a few questions-I just need advice on if this is decent enough for mostly my kids. for $220 it seems ok. They want to play Minecraft w/mods installed, Lego worlds, and my older one possibly games like assassin's creed 4 black flag,etc. Advide from people who know what they're talking about is much appreciated! Here's the info from the ad:
Custom built desktop PC with i5 650 CPU, 8G RAM, 250G HD, and AMD RADEON HD 7570 GPU. Has a high quality Seasonic 300 watt PSU. Monitor, keyboard, mouse are not included. Power cable and VGA adapter for the graphics card are included. The i5 650 is a fast dual core processor with hyperthreading, so it displays 4 threads in Task Manager. It is comparable to some of the current generation Core i3 CPUs. This CPU is over clocked to 3.575 ghz and turbos up to 3.718. This is a conservative overclock which runs very cool and stable.  This has an H55 LGA 1156 motherboard which has 4 slots for RAM. I believe these motherboards can have up to 16GB RAM. Right now it has 4x2GB 1333MHz DDR3 Kingston RAM sticks. So all the slots are full right now.

The HD 7570 GPU is an OEM entry level gaming card with 1 gig DDR3 VRAM. It uses an OEM driver which is already installed and a copy is also on the desktop. I would recommend keeping the OEM driver as-is and not using a newer AMD driver.

TITLE:  Should I get an X-Ray?
BODY: I'm a 13 year old goalkeeper, and just under a week ago I was playing at a collegiate camp. I went up for a cross, and an older camper came in at the same time and drove her knee into my right ribs. I kept playing, hoping the pain would subside (it didn't) and went to two more training sessions as well as another game that day before finally going to the trainers to get ice. They checked my ribs at the field, and said there was substantial swelling around the ribs, and they were probably bruised, but there was also a good chance they were cracked. The next morning, it hurt pretty bad to breathe deeply/cough/sneeze/hiccup/etc. the trainers told me to stop by before breakfast, and when I did, I had to convince them to let me play that day. (might not have been my brightest idea) Anyways, now that I'm back home, my ribs are still extremely  painful, and any pressure to my right side is even worse. I haven't gotten them xrayed, as I figured I could walk it off, but now that it has been a week, I'm starting to reconsider not getting them looked at. Should I get an x-Ray? I've read that's there isn't much you can do for cracked or bruised ribs, but the pain is awful...

TITLE:  Should I introduce another goldfish to my tank?
BODY: I have a 4 year old goldfish that lives in a 20-gallon tank at the moment. I'm planning to get a 30gal soon and was wondering if I should get another goldfish/compatible type of fish to keep him company. He is about 3-4 inches. I know that goldfish produce a ton of ammonia but I have a filter to handle that appropriately. My main concern is that he'd eat any smaller fish (as goldfish tend to eat whatever's smaller than them). He was originally from a carnival so he's lived with other fish before but I just don't want to spend money on a fish just for him to eat it, not befriend it. Do you know of fish that are compatible/types of goldfish?

TITLE:  Google Chrome won t start up. It loads and then nothing happens. I need help.?
BODY: Okay so here s the problem. After using my computer for a while, my google chrome suddenly stops opening up. I have to restart the computer for it to work (problem solved, right?) No, cause after a few hours the same problem occurs again. I have reset my computer totally two times now, and the problem just keeps coming back. 

Before getting any help I can confirm that it is not any sort of malware or virus because I have searched through my computer everytime this has happened. And I have tried to do the "-no-sandbox" thing but it literally takes 30 minutes for it to open up so I might aswell not even try. Are there any other solutions because I am getting tired of this. 

Thanks in advance.

TITLE:  Long white thing came out from between teeth?
BODY: I had some pain in my tooth and when i checked in the mirror the gums around where the pain was were swollen and bleeding. I got some floss and went in between the teeth where the pain was. I saw something white, i couldnt get it out with floss so i had to pull out with my fingernails. It was long and white like a peice if chicken or something and it smelt like literal poo. I washed mouth out with numbing antiseptic mouth rinse. Hopefully this will aid in preventing infection. Is this because i dont floss? I never floss i only brush my teeth in the morning.

TITLE:  How do I get my cats to get along?
BODY: I have a cat named Tigger. He is a year and a half years old. He is declawed in the front and never uses his back claes for defense or attack. He is an apt cat, and when he was a baby my friends would man handle him and one time got him high which pissed me off. He doesn t really like certain people either. I lived up north a while ago and there was another cat there. She wasn t declawed and would always go after Tigger and intentionally scratch him, hold him down and start fights with him. Now he lives in my apt again. 

When I first introduced Simba to Tigger, I think Tigger was a little scared. But now he is putting on a shpw for Simba and acting all bad and tough. He keeps stalking Simba. He follows him around the house, keeping his distance and growls. When Simba gets too close, Tigger will hiss and run away then regreat back to come stalk Simba. I m not sure why, but Simba likes to sometimes go as close as he can to Tigger until Tigger hisses. He is scared of Tigger, but likes to try and approach him. I introduced them on July 11th. They didnt like eachother. I kept them away from eachother until last night (July 15) and now this stalking and approaching is happening. 

I know I have to give it some time, but I want to know if there is anything I can do to get them to get along, or even to just get Tigger to stop Stalking Simba. Will Tigger eventually give in and just stop stalking him after a while? 

So please answer all my questions. Thank yoy for your time.

I really like it because she said that it was a powder as well as a blush and bronzer, so it already gives your face a glory and bronzed look without having to buy the other products. And I really like it on my face. It is $32.00. I think that is a good price, but I just wanted to know everyone else's opinion on it. Thanks!

BODY: I just got a tattoo on my inner forearm 2 days ago. I have 6 other tattoos so I m not new to this, but this is the first on my arm. It was a sensitive spot and I think the artist was a little heavy handed. But my arm and hand feel cold and a little numb. My fingers are tingling. Is this normal?? My tattoo also has a faint red area around the outside, nothing to scary looking though. The tat looks fine though. I m assuming this is just a sensitive spot and maybe a nerve was touched.

BODY: I am going to be a basketball referee this upcoming season after going through training sessions. I already have my uniform apparel ordered, but I do not have a wrist watch because none of the instructors specifically mentioned anything pertaining to watches; they told me which shirt, pants, and shoes to buy and from where. Any advice from ACTUAL current or former referees would be helpful. If you are not or were never a referee, please do not provide input.

TITLE:  Where can I buy Ongadori chickens?
BODY: I live in America, so I can't have them shipped from Japan. More specifically, I live in Michigan.

I've raised chickens all my life and I'm aware that I'd need to take special care of the Ongadori, such as custom perches and grooming the long tail feathers.

Is there anyone in the US who breeds them? I want chicks, not hatching eggs. A lot of people who sell the eggs will try to scam you with a Phoenix instead of the real deal.

For those of you who have them or breed them, how much do they cost to buy?

Thank you

(The paper I have is free hand, which I can manage but it can still be messy.) I plan on cleaning the skin, then drawing the outline in sharpie, then using black ink on my liner to go over it. I had my tattoo artist do it before, but I wanted some opinions.

TITLE:  Owning an exotic/hybrid cat?
BODY: What is it like owning one of these hybrid cats?
I have had thoughts of acquiring one after I finish up college and get my own place. I have owned a ton of cats through out my life, mostly strays and rescues that I have taken in. I am aware that they are a very expensive cat but I am willing to pay for the right one. I am also aware that they are not typical house cats and that they need lots of stimulation and exercise to keep them happy and satisfied. I'll give you a little about me so you know where it would be going.

I am a young adult female in my early twenties and have plans to move so I can attend a cat grooming school as well as study cat behavior and nutrition. I have owned cats since I was 3 years old. I will be living alone but will have one other cat with me because I had adopted her almost 3 years ago. I am a huge cat lover and have loved the way most the exotics look and am loving how active and more interactive they are. I will not be getting the cat until after all of my schooling is over with so I can focus more on getting one and putting money aside for things that it will need. I will most likely be living in a 2 bedroom apartment but there is also a possibility that I could be renting a home.

I'm sure most complexes wont allow a Savannah but do you think they would allow a little bit smaller exotic cat? If not then I'm also considering a Sphynx as they are one of my favorites and I've already done my research on them.

TITLE:  My bearded dragon jumped out of my hand?
BODY: I was holding him cause he was wanting out. So I picked him up out of the cage, which is a 55 gallon, for him to be in my hand. He is only 2-3 years old. While I was holding he jump out of my hand, and I'm pretty sure he hit his back on the ground and hit his head on the wheel on my rolly chair. Then again this was on a yard from the ground. Should I be worried? Could he have a concussion? He is acting normal and eating fine.

TITLE:  Cat seems depressed, stinks, drools, and is losing a lot of weight? Please help!!!!!!?
BODY: My cat, Macho Man, has recently over the past month or two been losing a lot of weight and he seems very absent and depressed. He has always been a moody cat who is always off outside on his own and has even gotten into some neighborhood cat fights. But he never really fights anymore and he has never come back with more than a few scratches and once a little bit of swelling. But anyway, he started to stink- like a mix of cat food, poop, and death. He smells really bad. He has been sleeping a lot lately too. Today I noticed that he has continuous drool coming from his mouth. He is also very sweet at this point and does nothing but sleep. He only gets angry if you mess with him too much and he s not short tempered like usual. Does anyone know what could be wrong with him?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?????? Please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

TITLE:  Will I have enough time to become good at hockey?
BODY: Hello, I am a 15 year old entering my sophomore year in high school. Recently, I got into ice hockey. I live in south carolina, so it is hard to come across this sport. A league nearby for my age will start next spring/summer. As of right now, I have a few skating lessons under my belt, which have given me decent skills (skating forwards, turning, stopping, and balance). Off ice, I have acceptable shooting skills, but I am constantly working on shooting with youtube tutorials (Which have insanely helped). A major concern I have is time that I can devote to hockey. Like I mentioned, I am entering 10th grade, in all honors classes. This means tons of homework, on top of my job. I am very frustrated due to this. I have to fit getting into shape, lessons, and everything else into a very short timeframe. I really want to be good at hockey eventually, but with only a few more years until adulthood and college, there is a lot of pressure. Do you think I have enough time (a little under 1 year) to develop proper skills that will carry me on to higher levels? Thanks!

TITLE:  Is it normal for a tattoo to be REALLY sore days after getting it?
BODY: I got a tattoo done on my lower leg/shin two days ago and it still is extremely sore. My shin bone hurts to walk and my skin even stings when I am resting. I have been following my artists instructions by washing it w/ antibacterial soap 3x a day and putting a thin layer of aquaphor on it. There is no swelling, no bleeding, no discharge, no itching, and no redness... This is my second tattoo and my first didn't hurt all after getting it done so after hearing about possible Infection and allergies I'm just really concerned. So this normal? And is there anything I can do to lessen the pain?

Thanks in advance!

In the past, I have attempted to get a hairstyle like the Wild Thing haircut, or an uppercut, in a result, two weeks later my hair would grow long and the side will always stick out like a clown. Thats why most of the time I would either have my hair long or get a buzz cut. But I really want a hairstyle like an uppercut. My hair keeps growing which is really annoying! It can grow to 3 inches a month!

TITLE:  I need a new monitor for my custom PC.?
BODY: Just recently, I finally managed to pool up enough money to build my new gaming PC. But, there's one little problem: while this rig can run 4k games with ease... I don't have a 4k monitor. I've been looking around, but I have yet to find a UHD (3840x2160 pixels) 4k monitor with 120 hz refresh. I've seen a lot of the 60 hz ones, but I want to get a 120 hz refresh model for that over 60 fps feel. Please help me find a 120 hz 4k UHD (3840x2160 pixels) monitor for my computer! Thanks in advance for your help!

TITLE:  Why does it seem that people in the small town I lived in, had it out for me from day one? I am a privilidged person and here is my story.?
BODY: So I lived in a small town and recently moved away. People in the small town always seemed to carry a chip on their shoulder against me. When I moved there, I moved from a very affluent suburb. I always chose to associate with people who were not living in the small town. I did not associate with any of the small town people. Some were nice to me but some wouldn't even acknowledge me. Many of them would give me dirty looks when they ran into me in public and give me the cold shoulder.

Why are small town people like that? I never did anything to them. The only thing they knew of me was my background.

BODY: Today, I noticed that my toenail has a horizontal crack near the base of the nail, from one end to the other.

It doesn't hurt, and I hadn't even realized that it was cracked like that. It had a bit of infection, so I put peroxide on it.

I probably broke it when I dropped something on it, I do that all the time...

Will it grow back normally if it was broken near the very bottom? I'm worried because it's a horizontal crack.

(Eating more hay than usual) and earlier I believed she was coughing because I've never heard that sound before also I checked her nose and there wasn't discharge anywhere but there was some little black specks. She had fleas once and treated it already. Also she does scratch herself every once in a while which I believe is normal but I'm really not sure and I'm very nervous because I'm a new guinea pig owner and still learning about them, I've done a ton of research but it doesn't seem to be helping so please tell me what this means :c I really love my piggies and it just makes me cry if they had an illness because my family wouldn't afford taking her to a vet but if I have to idk what to do so can one of you please tell me this is not an illness :c

BODY: This summer I hadn t run much more than 4.5 miles. 
I spontaneously decided 3 days though to go with a friend on an 11 mile run (of which we walked a couple miles)
Still, my legs took a toll and were dead by the end of the run. 
They re not sore now when I m not running but every time I ve tried to run since then they have been extremely uncomfortable in the front shins and ankles.
I really want to get running again. 
Should I just wait it out or is it not a big deal to just kind of ignore since it is only uncomfortable when I m actually running?
Would running with it do more harm than good?

TITLE:  How do I move 3 cats into a new place?
BODY: I have 3 cats. The oldest is 10, then 6 and the youngest is 10 months old. We are moving into a house and the cats have never lived in a house. We ve been living in a garage with no insulation, running water, or electricity for the last 7 years because of financial problems. Only the oldest cat has ever lived in an apartment. All the cats are female and rescues and I am concerned that moving to an actual home with a bathroom, kitchen, and more than one room will freak them out. I know moving can be stressful for cats and this is a very unique situation, being we ve pretty much been homeless for so long. This will be the first time with furnishings for the two younger ones also. They are very loved and well taken care of and want them to feel safe and loved through this transition. How can I make this situation easier for my babies?

BODY: Charlie is 7 months year old. At the petstore they told me he was a purebred Persian. I've seen his mother, which really looks like a purebred. Charlie however doesn't look like one. The vet took a look at him and said he's probably a mixed Persian/Angora. I really don't care if he's purebred or not, I'll love him just the same. I just want to know what breed do you think he is?

TITLE:  I hurt my back really bad... What do I do?
BODY: So I was bouncing on a trampoline. I'm 12 years old and I was sitting criss cross in the middle of the trampoline. There were 3 16-19 year old guys sorta forming a triangle around me. They bounced really low and counted to three when they got to three they each jumped about 3 feet in the air and landed at the same time. My body jerked forward and I was up 9-11 feet in the air. I landed fine but when I jerked forward I could hear and feel a crack from my lower back to the lower area of my neck. This happened yesterday and my back still hurts really bad. It hurts when I look up or move around and sometimes when I breath if I'm leaning forward. I've tried popping my back but that didn't work. I'm very active and parkour is my favorite thing to do and I'm pretty upset because I can't run without it hurting and if i jump even 5 inches up it hurts when I land. What do I do?

TITLE:  How to know when the girth is tight enough?
BODY: Hi,
 
I'm 13 years old, have been riding english for over two years, i do group canters in my lesson, trot over cross rails, but i'm never sure how tight the girth should be...most of the time, i'll tighten it to whatever i think is good, and if i want her to, my instructor will check...she only checks if i ask her to, which i normally do, since she seems to think that i do it fine...and it's only a few times that she's had to readjust it, but i still I don't want it to be too tight, or uncomfortable in any way to the horse, but how do i know if it's to tight or loose? I'm gonna start leasing my own horse, but if i can't figure something out as simple as this, i don't know what i'll do... Thanks so much!!!!

Can we PLEASE stop talking about Floyd Mayweather breaking Rocky Marciano's record? .?
BODY: Do you see just how RIDICULOUS this sounds?  Julio Cesar Chavez broke that "Record" long ago by going 89-0.  Granted, he got some "Gift" decisions along the way but you didn't hear anyone making comparisons when he approached the 49 mark.  Hell, half of America had no idea who Chavez was when he was 49-0. 
.
Hearing these comparisons between Mayweather and Marciano just sounds so CHEAP.

My mom did it the first time around with my help, but the second time around he just wouldn't do it. I could wrap him in a towel, he outright refused to come out from beneath the bed after that. I ended up having him  on my lap like a baby while holdih him by the scruff of his neck. I even made him BLEED on accident because he struggled so badly. I felt terrible. Now he's hiding under the bed from me and won't even come out for his favorite wet food. I feel awful.

TITLE:  Help with Rummy Nose Tetras and different carpeting plants!?
BODY: Hey, I recently bought 10 rummy nose tetras for my 28L tank,they are the only other fish in there except for a small "clean up crew" fish. The tank is about 2 weeks old and I was wondering what plants do they like to live with and what other fish are they compatible with? I would also like to know if there is a carpet plant that grows kinda slowly (slower than moderate) and grows to a height of around 2-4cm something like Dwarf Hairgrass (Eleocharis acicularis) but the only thing is that grows too quickly and gets quite tall, any help is very much appreciated!!

TITLE:  What is the proper tongue resting position?
BODY: Now, for my whole life, up to this point, I ve been resting my tongue just behind my front, lower teeth.
However, some guy named Dr Mike Mew (look him up)
claims (with way too much passion) that the anatomically correct tongue posture is on the roof of one s mouth, because it prevents orthodontic problems and sculpts a better jawline. I ve tried it for a day or two, and it s honestly not that bad.

Do Dr Mew s claims have any scientific basis, or are they just BS? And, more importantly, can there be any problems that can be caused from resting the tongue on the roof of the mouth?
I d prefer it if someone with actual medical experience answered. Thank you all in advance.

Best answer gets 5 stars, go!

TITLE:  How long does it take to make disposable contact lenses?
BODY: So if I have an eye appointment on Friday and I'm getting disposable contacts, how long would it take for them to be made?

I'd really like to have them before the 22nd because I'm going on a 4 day trip out of town for band camp, and we're going to be out in the blazing sun for most of the day. It'd be nice to have them by then because my glasses's transition lenses aren't very dark and I prefer to have normal sunglasses (which don't fit over glasses, unfortunately).

Any help would be appreciated!

Now it feels sore and tender every time I try to stretch it out. Rest or stretch? I have a high school (non mandatory) summer practice today. Any input on what I should do, and if I should go?

I also tried an ice bath, it didn't help very much.

I have a really small mouth and it takes A LOT of effort for me to smile, it's like my mouth would rather shut close. However, for Asians they just seem to be walking around showing off their teeth with no hard effort.

What gives?

TITLE:  Broodmare health?
BODY: This year I am leasing a broodmare to breed to my stallion. When I got her, she was in poor health. I got her teeth floated. I'm giving her grain (sweet feed) and corn, keeping her on good green grass and nice hay when she is in a stall. I put vegetable oil on her gain in the morning and Recently I started her on Farnam's VITA PLUS. Although she is gaining weight and looks great compared to what she did, she still isn't filling out on her top line and neck.. Could she be low in iron? Or need more protein? Also She has been with my stallion since May and still coming into heat and my stallion is covering her. So I feel like whatever she needs is effecting her reproduction.. The other mares bred to my stallion have took so it's not the stud. She is 18 and has been a broodmare for 10+ years, but she has had a three year break from breeding.

BODY: I am 13 years old and I am starting to train the owner of my boarding facilities horse. The owner is getting old and he can't do it him self. The horse is five years old and has only had a lot of  ground work done. I have worked him on the ground and he has had desensitizing. I have already ridden him four times(only walking) and we have made progress. But how do you teach him to neck rein, do rollbacks and things like that?

TITLE:  Bird vs Gerbil? Which one do you think would be better for me?
BODY: I'm 17, have almost 1 year old baby sister who has downs. But it will probably be a year or two before shes walking. I have 2 dogs, 1 nosy annoying cat who cares more about my dad than she does me. 2 betta and 3 guppies. I won't be going to college, I don't have many friends. I've experienced guinea pigs but they weren't worth the trouble. They kicked their bedding out of their cages all the time and were expensive with the veggies, hay and bedding. The male was a bit of a biter and both always peed on me when holding them. And I didn't even hold them for like five minutes. If this helps I have a habit of always sleeping with my light on. So I don't know if that would affect owning either of them. I'm a online student so home 24/7 besides riding with my mom to dr appointments for my sister or going out of state maybe 4 times at the most a year for about a week each.

My mom said if I get a bird it should be a cockatiel. But I think thats to expensive for me to be a first time owner of a cockatiel. Shes had cockatiels before but I would be the one caring for it. I was thinking a parakeet. But even getting a bird has to wait until after we move sometime this winter.  I'm wondering if I could get a gerbil here and move with it later. Or would it stress it out to much? I know nothing at all about Gerbils. I don't now anyone thats had one. My older sister when I was about six might have had a hamster or a gerbil but I don't remember it I just remember a colorful cage.

TITLE:  Braces Overbite question, in need of serious help!?
BODY: So Ive had braces for a year and a half almost 2 soon.  I expected by now to see reducing of the protruding upper lip by now and yes it has gone down but not completely. I asked my dentist today if my lips are going to stay like this and he said yes, because I was born with these lips.. My overbite is gone, but my lips stayed the same? They look the exact same way they did 2 years ago. the treatment is almost over even though my upper lip is still protruding hideously.. ive looked at videos of people with overbites and most of them got teeth removed, So i asked him if i was supposed to get an extraction and he said that if i was going to extract 2 teeth from that top, 2 had to be removed from the bottom as well. and he said that's not a good option for me, but why? If it gets rid of this hideous lip protruding effect it most definitely is in my best interest. Please help? What am i supposed to do? How does my protruding lip go away? any surgeries? Are extractions really not in my best interest?

BODY: Most history books always say that when the Germans attacked Russia in the summer of 1941 the Russians were completely unprepared and that Stalin refused to believe the attack had actually happened, Russian units were told in official orders not to engage German troops. It is certainly true that the Russians were unprepared for such an attack, but were they actually massing their troops on the border so they could launch a pre-emptive attack on Germany themselves?

The back and side of my ankle have been hurting and were bruised a little. And i cannot bend my foot up and down and i can barely move my big toe. Every time i bend it downwards, it feels like the pain travels from my toe to maybe mid foot. Im not quite sure whats wrong because its never happened to me before. Thank you for helping! :)

How much does food cost?

How much (and how often) to care for their teeth and hooves?

If my horse gets sick, how much would a vet charge me? Say, if it gets colic?

I'm aware that I need to do a lot more research before getting a horse, and I probably won't own one for at least five more years. I was just curious as to how much one horse's care would cost me.

TITLE:  I'm a natural ginger, ginger hair freckles and all. I've had ombre hair for quite some time now, and today I decided to dye it back....?
BODY: I asked to dye it back to my natural hair state, I showed her a picture of Holland Roden because we have similar natural hair color. So pretty much I was asking my hairdresser to match my hair color to my roots growing in. She nods her head and is very confident with whats she's doing.
 
The end result, I look like a freaking fire truck! She didn't notice my disappointment and by the end neither my mom or I said anything to the hairdresser. In the car I started crying and the tears wouldn't stop! My mom was so kind to pay 75 dollars for this, and I hate it!

I want this horrid color out of my hair and I want my ginger hair back. Please help me! What can I do?

BODY: I'm almost 14 and when i was changing back into my clothing earlier today after swimming in my pool, cleaning this green stuff because my dad told me too, i noticed there were white, or maybe blonde, pubic hairs instead of light brown. Is this normal? Are they maybe blonde hairs? My legs go from blonde hair to light brown so maybe they're blonde? If they're white, what do I do?

TITLE:  I accidentally bruised my girlfriend's ribs! How can I make it up to her?
BODY: My girlfriend and I (we're lesbians) were goofing off and sparring together in our living room (we both took self defense classes. I'm a purple belt, she's a 1st degree black belt) We never ever hurt each other or get too rough, but this time, I accidentally knocked her over the counter, and she landed on my metal pair of nun-chucks. She screamed as soon as she landed, and couldn't get back up. I ran to her and she was holding onto her side and wasn't breathing properly. She took one look at me, and she could tell that I was about to cry. She kept trying to reassure me that she was okay, but I could already tell she wasn't and she was in a lot of pain. After a bit of pleading, she finally let me look at the damage I caused. Her side was badly bruised and swelling. I begged her to let me take her to the hospital and she finally agreed. It took more effort than it should have to get her up and help her into the car (she's bigger than me). After several hours at the hospital, we finally got home. The doctor gave her a prescription for an extra strength pain killer, and informed her boss that she won't be able to come in to work for the next month.

BODY: My cat is being treated for a UTI. I just took her to the vet today. The vet gave  her a shot of an antibiotic and also an anti inflammatory shot. I will be picking up the antibiotic tomorrow. I am so nervous she will never begin to use the litter box again as she has obviously been avoiding it for a few days since getting the UTI. She has already peed on the floor once since we have been home from the vet. I know I cant expect immediate results. Did your cat ever recover from a UTI and start using the litter box again?

TITLE:  Help! My turtle isn't eating!?
BODY: I have a painted turtle that I got around ten years ago. We got him from a friend though so I don't know his actual age. Lately, like for more than a month now, he has stopped eating. He has stopped eating for a while in the past but that was always during the winter. Right now it is the middle of summer where I am. I have tried to feed him various food from the usual reptile sticks to live worms but he wont eat anything. I only just got him a UVB lamp and a heating lamp recently (when he started to not eat) because when we got him we weren't informed really well. I still don't have a water heater for him though. Is the lack of heat and UVB in the past the reason he's not eating? If so how do I help him get better? There's no shell rot or anything. Also another thing I've noticed is that ever since he's started to not eat he's been acting crazy in the water. He swims around like he has no control and rams into things. Finally another cause might be that a few months ago my dad fed him some shrimp. But this shrimp was meant to be consumed by humans and was dried and salted and stuff. If there's any reptile experts out there please help! Thanks for reading through my question.

TITLE:  When is the right age to start wearing makeup?
BODY: Yesterday my younger cousin (she is age 12) called me and just poured her heart out with so many questions about makeup, I couldn't handle them all! Some of the questions she had I couldn't even answer myself. I'm 16 and my mom just simply said that I could wear a BB cream and light lipgloss when I was 13, mascara and blush at 14, and eye shadow and eye liner at 15. I totally missed age 12 when it comes to makeup! Here's what my cousin said:
    "Some of my friends started wearing makeup towards the end of the school year. Do you think it's normal for young girls to wear makeup in the sixth grade? When do you think I should start wearing makeup? How much makeup? Should I sneak it or ask my mom about the issue of makeup? I'm sort of scared to talk to my mom about makeup. When should I bring it up? In two years, I don't know!? What makeup should I wear whenever I DO start wearing makeup? What brands also?"
    Those were my cousin's exact words. I had NO IDEA what to say to her, so I said that I was having connection problems (which, yes, was very rude, I know) and hung up. I know my cousin has a lot of questions that need to be answered, but please answer as many as you can ASAP. Thanks! :)

BODY: I have short hair and I'm only going to bleach the front and top (Keeping the roots brown). Think Miley Cyrus - kind of

Each morning my hair has zero volume and clearly oily, so I can either have awful looking hair or I wash it. (Of course I choose to wash it)

I'm definitely bleaching it, no way can I get talked out of it, but I'm not sure if it's okay to wash it every morning? Should I get a different shampoo to use?

Don't say dry shampoo, it didn't do anything.

BODY: So two days ago i got a root canal on my front right tooth. At the time I had only begun to have a swollen lip that night (made the procedure awful). I was prescribed clindamycin (150mg) to take every 6 hours. Its been a couple days and my cheek is still swollen, with the focus being tender and more solid around my nose. I ve been told that some of this might be an overreaction to the cleaning agent that may have gotten into the tissue and irritated it. Should I be worried, or do the antibiotics take a while to start dropping the swelling?

BODY: I got a 2 month old kitten 1 day ago . She had been previously been fed kitten formula. Her first solid meal had been a slice of turkey as well as a slice of ham. (Whoops). And so far she does not seem to eat any of the dry food or canned food. Granted I did try feeding her a can of friskies as well as fancy feast. (I m a first time cat owner give me a break). Anyways, I m not sure what to feed her. She s being a little too stubborn and I m not sure what else to do.  I can t keep feeding her processed meat, I can already hear the vets everywhere yelling at me about how the food I m feeding her isn t meeting her nutritional requirements.

TITLE:  Magical/mystical scene?
BODY: hey, does this flow well...or not?

She waited for me in the darkest thicket of the forest. The pines and oaks grew so heavy I could hardly  see her, but I knew she was there. I knew it as sure as I could smell ferric rust falling off diseased fig trees or hear the soft pant of saltwater lapping in a crystalline pond. I knew it from the way my knees buckled as I drew nearer and nearer to the lonely little niche where she sat, surrounded by flowers and bathing in golden light. It was a strange dead place, this forest, with its mess of moss and rot and things unseen growing and moving beneath a thick skin of litterfall. Its unnatural brightness blazed all around us like a terrible sort of lightning but she urged me on, so I went  forward with my gaze fixed on her and her alone. She is a god, I thought, when finally I reached her side. I felt the warmth of the ground around her, the earth so much more inviting, the grass so much silkier than even a few feet away. Slowly, I let myself kneel before her. My lips find the soft ample flesh just beneath her knee and I kiss her there as any man would greet a King. She is a spirit of the wood. I see that in her green eyes. In the way they are so prettily flecked with gold.

The US economy suffered from having to pay reparations to European nations after the war ended.
The peace agreements with other countries opened up new markets for the US which improved the US economy.
The economy was in turmoil.
The economy flourished after the end of the war. What plan did Wilson bring to Paris on behalf of the United States government during the Peace of Paris Conference?

Wilson promised to aid all countries who participated in the war with financial aid for reparations.
WIlson implemented a peace plan called the Fourteen Points.
Wilson offered military security to Europeans powers whose militaries had tarnished.
Wilson only offered his promises in the League of Nation.

TITLE:  How do I get my kitten to use the litter box?
BODY: I have tried a couple of things, but she's only been doing her business on the floor!!

1. I got a small aluminum pan and put litter in it, and showed it to her, but she still did her business in the same area as her litter box

2. I bought a cover for it (more private), and she still doesn't use it

3. At night I locked her in the bathroom with toys, water, food, and the litter box and she still never used it

(Also if it helps, the litter is like sand)

Any suggestions on how I can fix this problem?????

BODY: I've been riding him in just a halter. I'm looking to further his training. The last horse I broke, was this one's polar opposite. I trained her in a regular snaffle and switched to a bosal. Very gentle and willing horse, but she had "anxiety issues". Should I train my current horse to a snaffle? He is very strong willed, and stubborn. But he is very smart. I don't want to have a bit that hurts him even if its used correctly. He doesn't need it. What bit should I use? I ride western. Also, could you tell me a little more about the bit below? A friend gave it to me to use. I haven't used it because I don't know anything about it? Pro's and Con's? Please no rude answers, thanks!

The reason im asking is because several years ago when my brother was a senior he had to guard this one dude in a play off game and he actually shut him down in tha 1st half but came out shooting from the timeline and that motha fu*a would not miss. But anyway my dad and I were arguing on how many feet he was shooting from and kept on trying to tell that the distance from the goal to the top off the key (NBA) isn't the same thing. The dudes name was sheldon earl and he played for lancaster if yall have ever heard of him.

BODY: Today I noticed that my arm hair is dark blonde. Also I saw my little brothers arm hair and it was also blonde but he has black hair. My hair is dark blonde. But I don't think that my arm hair looks blonde in the sun. Only next to a regular light. Does it it look like that just because of the light?

TITLE:  What's the tone in this poem?
BODY: In the desert 
I saw a creature, naked, bestial, 
who, squatting upon the ground, 
Held his heart in his hands, 
And ate of it. 
I said, "Is it good, friend?" 
"It is bitter bitter," he answered; 
"But I like it 
Because it is bitter, 
And because it is my heart."

I have to identify and examine the poet's use of imagery,adjectives,tone, and dialogue. Please help

TITLE:  Shinny face. Better make up?
BODY: I am 16 years old, and ever since I started wearing make up (14) I noticed I have a really shinny T-bone )or whatever it's called) on my forehead. Not only that, but also my nose, under my eyes, and my chin. It's not so much oily, just my make up just doesn't like to stick. And now that it's summer, it's even worse! It also happens in winter, too. But I've bought many BB creams for redness and shinny faces, to make them matte. But nothing's worked so far! I constantly have to bring face powder with me every where and to find time to powder my face so the embarrassing shine in the lighting of the room doesn't show. Please, help me did a foundation, daily wash, or just anything that can make this go away! It really brings my self-esteem down. Thank you!

TITLE:  Writing style?
BODY: She waited for me in the darkest thicket of the forest. The pines and oaks grew so heavy I could hardly  see her, but I knew she was there. I knew it as sure as I could smell ferric rust falling off diseased fig trees or hear the soft pant of saltwater lapping in a crystalline pond. I knew it from the way my knees buckled as I drew nearer and nearer to the lonely little niche where she sat, surrounded by flowers and bathing in golden light.

TITLE:  Sharp pain in elbow when lifting or steering?
BODY: I am a 50 year old active male. I have a job and a home with 200 acres that requires a lot of manual work. I ve noticed within the last couple months that I ve been having issues with my elbow. When I go to lift something heavy I have a pain so sharp that I don t even want to lift it. I also notice my forearm becoming very sore when something like this occurs. I usually steer with one arm but I have noticed this also irritates the situation. I have done some research online about distal bicep tendon tears and ruptures. I have also looked at bicep tendonitis. I have the sharp pain that they mention but I do not have any inflammation or bruising or bumps or gaps on or near my elbow. I would really like to do some rehab stretches and understand what is wrong. If anyone has any ideas, any at all, please let me know. Thank You!!

TITLE:  Feeling deeply guilty for rehoming my cat?
BODY: I really loved my cat, he was constantly by my side. I had him since he was a kitten and he was 2 years old when I rehomed him last year. He was super attached to me, he would stare at me and was very affectionate. I had to give him to a no-kill shelter for reasons that were unavoidable (health reasons and financial reasons). I really miss him. I kept in touch with the shelter and after about a month or two he was adopted. I have no idea who adopted him. I keep worrying about his new home and whether or not he's with the right people. How can I move past this? Not knowing is the worst part.

TITLE:  Tips for someone who is new to horses?
BODY: I really want to buy a horse in the distant future, and I would like some tips and advice. I live in Michigan, and I'm 18 years old. I won't be able to buy one for at least seven years, until I finish college, so I have a lot of time to study up and take riding lessons.

I want my first horse to be large and stocky, around 16 hands at least. Which horses get that big, on average? So far, I like Paints and Clydesdales.

What is the difference between English and Western riding? Is one more difficult than the other?

Should I get a mare, a gelding, a colt, or a filly? Which of these do you think is the easiest to work with, for a first horse?

What was your first horse like? Was it stubborn or good-natured?

Any help would be appreciated. :)

BODY: I clean the tank and I usually put hot water in their tanks with the water purifier and let them sit until they're room temperature. I got into a fight with a family member and when I came upstairs, I transferred the betas to their bowls.... one of them became lethargic and the other started jutting around... starting to swim on his side and I Was thinking... what the heck is going on... then it occurred to me, I felt the water and it was REALLY warm, not scalding hot, but not livable, so I started pouring cold water in to cool it off, adding water purifier as I did so, and he started to act more normal.. he's just acting kinda lethargic and not his normal, active self. I'm so saddened... will he be alright? The other one is fine, his water wasn't as warm when I introduced him, though I did add the cold water, his tank is smaller, so it cooled down faster.. I'm a wreck. I love these fish to death... Please tell me if they'll be okay.

I was told that he will die without a mate. Plus I'm really worried about the eggs too. What should I do to save thm both? If I get him a new mate now, won't she break the eggs? So should I wait and watch for the eggs to hatch? Or should I just make a homemade incubator and put the eggs there and then buy another mate? But then I don't want to take the eggs away from the male. Please tell me what to do.

TITLE:  Any recommended hair dye that washes out?
BODY: So I want to dye my hair and have many times with kook aid but I hate how frequent I have to re-color. Does anyone recommend hair dye that will be out within a month? Only reason is I go to a catholic school and I need it out by the 31st of August or otherwise I can't attend school. Recommendations?

TITLE:  Should I change my Aquarium from freshwater to brackish?
BODY: I have a 10 gal freshwater tank equipped with medium sized gravel. Population is 1 pleco, 1 blackfin shark, 1 red Devil crab, and a few guppies. The tank seems overpopulated but I have worked very hard to make it into a good balance and none of the inhabitants show any signs of stress. 

Anyway, I was looking into creating an underwater air pocket for my crab since the lid doesn't let me see it when it's outside (which is a lot) and stumbled into a lot of sites that say that all of the fish in my tank do better in brackish than freshwater, especially the crab and the guppies. 

I just need to know whether its actually a good idea to transition or if I should leave it as is. 

Cheers!

I just want to know before hand, because I don t want to buying bad products that break weeks within purchase, or to even give them my credit card info if they were a sketchy site.

TITLE:  How can I wipe my computer?
BODY: I have a Vaio computer (not sure what year...maybe a 2007ish) and I can't acces it. It says that every password I put in that I can think I would have used is wrong. When I hit the reset password it tells me " The feature requires removal media such as floppy disk or USB flash drive. Please insert a floppy disk or connect a USB flash drive, and then try again." I put in a blank USB but then it tells me that isn't something to reset my password....so instead of buy a disk to reset my password I'm wondering if there is a possibility I can just completely wipe the computer of all data so I can just start over? Is this possible...if so how would I go about doing it without purchasing something to wipe my computer?

I was taking care of them just fine but my parents aren't used to the mess cats can make. Like throwing kitty litter everywhere. And unrolling toilet paper. But that's not their fault!! There are also coyotes in this area. My dad made a cute little cat home above my dog's house in my backyard and they love it but I get so worried that they will run away. I don't want them dead on the streets or in a coyote's stomach. How can I convince the world's most stubborn parents? Thnx

TITLE:  How do I convince my mom to give me her blessing on this tattoo?
BODY: One of my best friends died in his sleep on March 19, his name was Andy. We were 3 months from graduation. Basically since then, I've been wanting to get a tattoo for him (Small &amp;e on my wrist, I've been drawing it on my wrist since graduation day, still want it permanent). I am 18, but my parents blackmail me into manipulating me to do what they say. They did the same to my sister - telling her if she got a tattoo they'd cut off all her insurance and all this garbage. 
They were fairly pissed to say the least when she got hers (a large shoulder-piece of lyrics from Guns N' Roses' November Rain). 
For awhile she fought and then finally decided to "allow me", but soon revoked that after she found out i got my septum pierced without her knowing. 
I've already let her know I'm 18 and can legally make this decision myself and she's given me all these responses to what i say: 

1. what if you regret it (even though the person im getting it for is dead)
2. what if you need to hide it for a job (its less than 1inX1in
3. tattoos hurt (i dont care about the pain)
4. im your mom and though it might be your body, i made it for you. (not even going to say anything to this one)
5. if you get it itll break my heart

to be honest, I'm going to do this whether she wants me to or not, i'd just rather have her blessing (not going to say permission because its not her decision ultimately anyway) as to not cause trouble with her.

TITLE:  My baby fancy rats are very timid and scared?
BODY: They are both males and I have only had them for three days, but I don't think they should be this scared anymore. They stop playing when I come into the room and run into the corner when I go near the cage. They don't bite when I put my hand in the cage for them to sniff and will let me pet them but they jump at every little sound they hear and seem very scared. They've only actually come up to my hand once when I had food, and they don't anymore even when I offer them treats. I know that they're still adjusting to their new home but I think they should at least be calm by now. Please give me some ideas on making them happier and more comfortable!

I have a few tats already that are all black, I've had them for about 2 years now. In those 2 years I've been thinking about getting a colored tattoo.

I'm not too sure if they'd be good on my skin, but I'd like to get some advice from others .. Serious responses only please.

BODY: He is the best 3 point shooter in the NBA who can create his own shot (give me Korver off screens/spotting up). However why is he already "better" than Allen or Miller? At the pace he's going he could (and should) be the best but best shooter ever seems premature imo. Especially after his multiple sub-par performances in the Finals.

TITLE:  Watching a kitten for a few days, already have a cat.?
BODY: So, I m doing a coworker a favor and watch her kitten for a few days at my apartment. I have a 15 month old cat. My cat has been described as having a "dog" like personality (constantly needs to join groups of people, greets you at the door, plays with everyone, super active) so I figured this wouldn t be a problem. I think they re alright together. They ve been "wrestling" and chasing each other. The little one keeps exposing his belly while doing this and the big one pats the one without letting out his claws. However he sometimes hisses at the kitten when he gets a good sniff. Are we going to make it till Thursday without separation?

          So I've been on my computer all day working and occasionally playing games. About a half hour ago I got up to talk to someone. I wasn't gone 5 minutes, I came back and my monitor had gone black and it smelled slightly like burnt plastic (or burnt something). I noticed my tower was off and I tried to turn it back on with no luck. The burnt smell was coming from the small box at the top and back of the tower (the CPU I believe it's called). What do you think happened, and how can I fix it?

TITLE:  Blonde hair dye seems to have bleached my hair. When would be ok to dye it again?
BODY: I used to color my hair a ton but due to life and kids I stopped about a year ago. I decided last Friday I wanted to lighten it a little. It's normally an ashy blonde so I bought a blonde that appeared about a shade or two lighter not anything majorly different just a little fresher. Went home colored my hair and it's like orange now. I picked up some deep conditioning (argon oil I believe they are) packets while I was out Saturday and used on that day and another today and I have two other left. If I condition it tomorrow and then again Thursday would it be ok to color my hair a medium brownish on Friday or Saturday?

BODY: So a while ago I had fallen of the stairs and injured my back. When I went to the hospital they though I might have broken it or something so I had an xray done. Im not too sure but I think it was high radiation. I've heard that this damages egg cells and decreases chances of having children. I'm quite worried now that I may not be able to have children in the future. They did cover my ovaries but im still really worried it was the second time I had an xray I had one when I was younger but I dont remember having my ovaries covered then. In total I've only ever had two xrays done in my entire life. I need to to weather this will prevent me from having children im the future? Will i still be able to have children?

BODY: Sooooo I am a guy hah and I do care a ton about my hair.
So I bleached all the top except the sides just cause I thought it would look weird (I'm a weird person so It was funny) and I thought I was taking care of my hair after bleaching. I wouldn't wash my hair everyday id let it bask in it's natural oils, I got coconut oil and would apply on my hair (but stopped after like 7 uses cause I didn't like the feeling if oil touching my face at night (I have long hair)) I eat good, I drink nothing but water, I exercise maybe once a week but lately I've been doing "some" yoga and more work outs. I do try and take care of my body and my hair most of all. My hair continues to break, I now have an ombré affect my hair has grown sense I bleached it but will my hair Continue to break? I don't straighten my hair, I don't blow dry my hair, my hair is always in it's natural state. Is this normal? For breakage to continue after 4 months? And would it add damage if I died it back to black (my natural hair color). Please help me out ha I love my hair I hate seeing all these blonde hairs on my black shirts and my pillows and comb lol

So recently i shaved y'know /down there/ that was like, two days ago? and today, i wore tights all day, then i took ballet, which required more tights. and I felt mild discomfort/ irritation during the class and like i'm now experiencing redness and itchiness and so it would make sense that it was from all of that and not like, some random infection that just popped up in the last hour... right?

BODY: Ok, I have been using the mac pro long wear concealer mixed with my moisturizer (to thin out) as foundation for the past year. The bottle is small so i go through about 3 a year. I wanted to try this with the actual foundation version,but i am wondering if I am NC35 in concealer, is it the same number in the foundation? I am aware that the concealer must be 2-3 shades lighter, but when i was color matched, i asked for the exact shade as i had planned to use it in this way. Thanks!

Q 2. Would SamprasPrime benefit from today s racquet technology and sports medicine that he did not have in PRE 2003?


Q 3. Would SamprasPrime have difficulty with the Wimbledon grass VS Djokovic2015?

TITLE:  Why do my cats stare at the same place?
BODY: All cats I have owned in the past 16 years of living here have stared at the top corner of my living room and still to this day do so. Also when I was a child around 2-4 years of age I would sit at the top of the stairs and talk to some one and when my parents asked who it was I would say "I'm talking to denny." The place my cats stare at is some what connected to my stairs. Could my house have a ghost in it?

TITLE:  Pain after difficult extraction?
BODY: I had a pretty difficult extraction 5 days ago on my bottom molar (2nd from the back). It was an absolute pain to remove... pieces broke off, I had a few stitches, etc. so I completely expected to be in pain afterwards. It hasn't been so bad actually, but there is still a soreness there and sometimes a little aching. It does look like its healing nicely too, just slowly. Is it normal to have little pains 5 days after extraction? It's not severe pain and I know it's not dry socket...

TITLE:  Help with choosing a pre-professional ballet program?
BODY: I currently train at an excellent Vaganova school. It is an excellent program and I have improved a lot since I have been training at this school. However, I just got into San Francisco Ballet School and I have been placed in level 6. I do not know whether I should stay and train another year to get my Vaganova technique solid before going somewhere like that or if I should go. I have not asked my teachers about this yet, but I plan to soon. They would probably want me to stay, but I do not know if it is the right choice or not. It is great training, but I do not want to become stiff and unable to pick up choreography. For these are things I already struggle with. I am only fourteen years old, but I am afraid if I wait another year it will be too late to grasp onto other styles of dance that have a more free style like I enjoy. Any suggestions on what to do? Thanks so much!

TITLE:  Will my cat start spraying?
BODY: I have had my cat, Nona for about 6 years. He was a stray, when we found him he was about 3-4. He is neutered, and I have never seen him spray. And he has never sprayed in my house.  Today I found another stray male kitten who is about 8 weeks old. He is not neutered or litter trained, The kitten peed on a pillow which I washed and a little bit on my comforter. I am afraid my older cat will start spraying if he smells the kittens urine or just his scent in general. Do you think he will start spraying? Also my older cat is hissing at the baby, which for my cat is not that bad. Usually when other animals come Around he puffs up and arches his back and attacks. He did not do any of that just curious sniffing and occasional hissing. Do you think they will get along eventually? Thank you for answering!!

TITLE:  Why won't cat eat? Maybe loss of smell?
BODY: Hi I have who got really sick.. It started out with constant sneezing the next morning he didn't eat so he went to the vet he was running a fever got antibiotics he seemed to not get any better.. His nose got really swollen he wasn't acting better.. So he went back to the vet got fluids and a strong antibiotic and A/D prescription food to mix with water to force feed in hopes of his appetite returning.. He seemed better the next morning he was getting around but things went downhill the rest of the day he went back to the vet for his next antibiotic shot he took his temp and it dropped pretty dramatically which worries the vet it could be a sign of septic. two days later he gets his last shot of antibiotic and his temp is regulated So here we are its been a week since the beginning of this whole ordeal. He wants to act himself but is so week from hardly eating he can't. We can get him to eat a couple small pieces of tuna four times a day but that's it. He almost acts like he can't smell.. He tried to smell then looks confused kind of and if he decides to try to eat it he does this weird thing like he has to to taste it then spit it out and repeats until he decides to swallow. I mean maybe all that crazy sneezing that made his nose swell ruined his smell? Has anyone had a similar situation that maybe had to do with smell. Does his behavior seem like a cat who's lost smell? Oh he IS still drinking water! Just not eating!

I saw something, like a tiny, tiny hole. It looked a little dark and brown. I think its a cavity but I'm not sure. I hope it isn't. I just came back from the dentist THAT DAY, I don't think they would miss it. And since then I've been brushing my teeth 2-3 times a day... But if it is a cavity, what do I do to fight it? Home remedies?

BODY: Our cate (3y/o), very smart and always uses her litter box. I clean the box and change the pine litter regularly. 

We bought a new rug, and put it in the bedroom. So I was shocked when in the evening we found out that the cat pooped on it! 

The rug has some sort of smell (like all new rugs have). Do you think it is just the new object smell that she didnt like? However, we bought rugs before and it never happened! Will she continue doing this to that exact rug??

Do you guys have any suggestions as to how and what color I should color my hair? I have pale skin, blue eyes, and dirty-blondish hair which currently reaches my shoulders.

But yesterday she asked me if I could buy her her a makeup kit. I asked her why, because I wondered why she would want to put makeup on her pretty face. She said she wants to wear makeup because her friends at school are wearing makeup. What do I tell her? I don't want her to over-do it and have her go to school looking like a clown!

BODY: I got my braces off today about 10 hours ago and just now one of my top teeth started feeling really sensitive to cold water and cold air. My orthodontist said my hygiene looked great and I didn t have any of those white spots so it can t have anything to do with how I cleaned my teeth during braces. Someone said something about the vibrations from when the glue was getting sanded off causes this but I don t know. What I really want to know is why this is happening (like what could possibly cause this) and will it go away soon? I can t contact my orthodontist about this right now because it s 10:30pm so yeah :p let me know what you think.

TITLE:  How to rebound on nba2k14? (Or any nba2ks?)?
BODY: What i mean by that is: how do you let your main rebounders get all the rebound?? Like i see Deandre Jordan, Tyson Chandler, kevin love,  and those rebounding machines only getting like 4-6rebounds in 10minute quarter games.. Its like they hahe opportunities to get 15+ rebounds every game but they let other guys just get the reb.
Is there any way i can DESIGNATE one player to get all the rebounders? For all the defensive rebounds instead of four of my players jumping to get a rebound, can i just make the center get it like how they do it in REAL nba games???
It frustrates me

TITLE:  I just found a microchip in my (previously stray) cat from her previous owner. I have had her for 6 YEARS and don't know what to do.?
BODY: About 6 years ago, a stray cat started wondering around my friends house. The weather was getting colder, and I did not want her to freeze to death, so I took her in. I think she was abused because she is very timid and hates teenage men. I took her to the vet and got her all fixed up. I have been living with her for about 6 years now. She is a very sweet cat and I have grown very attached to her. At her yearly vet checkup, I decided to get her microchipped in-case she got lost. The vet first checked for existing microchips and found one! I was amazed! I did not look up the chip number because I really can’t give her back after she spent most of her life with me. I feel like the original owner(s) got over losing her by now and assume she died. I feel like I should at least call them to let them know she’s alive and in good hands. But I don’t want to start a big legal custody battle. She has changed my life and I could never give her up now. I don’t think she had a good home before. I don’t know what to do.

It almost feels like a giant bruise but I don't really see a bruise or anything there but it hurts a lot. At first it hurt to walk and then I iced it for a few days and didn't wear flip flops during that time period and it helped a lot because the top of my foot only hurt a little and only when I would flex it. Today I wore flip flops for like an hour and didn't really walk much in them and now my foot hurts really bad again. I know that it's probably because of my flip flops but I was wondering if anyone knows what could be wrong with it? I've never had a problem with flip flops before.

TITLE:  Cross Country?
BODY: I'm a 16 year old male and I participate in cross country do my high school. I run 3-5 miles a day and have one long run a week which is usually 10 miles and take 1 day off. I have a healthy diet. Very rarely ever eat junk food or drink soda. This upcoming season I am going to be the best runner on the team compared to last year I was the third best. My mile time is usually anywhere from 5:05 to 5:20. No matter how hard I try I can't get my mile into the 4 minute mark. Can anyone help me with advice should I start running more or less? Any foods that can give me a burst of energy. Any good running sneakers? Also I live in Connecticut and we have the worst weather for running hot and super humid... It's killer. Any advice would be awesome,thanks!

It's like he's coughing and his tongue always sticks out when he does it. It's somewhat getting better. The first 2 days he would have 4-5 hacks in a row, but now it's only  1-2 like every 2 hours-ish.

It's getting really annoying, not annoying enough to freak out, it's just bothering me by thinking about it. So, i just see double when I relax my eyes, I mean I can still see everything and read, but I just don;t like it. What's wrong with me? Also, this may have started when I first got glasses 4-5 years ago, (I can't see far things, about -3.5 or something, I don't know)

TITLE:  Hi. I'm trying to find my father's family. He and his family were from Dubai. Where can I find help?
BODY: I don't have much to go on other than the fact that I know his name and I have some pictures of him.

 I've never met him. After 15 years I've come to the conclusion that he's long dead,however I know that he had loving parents and a sister.

I know that he met my mother in a University in Riga,but I don't know the name of said University. I was hoping to find some sort of Dubai People Forum where I could post his pictures,maybe somebody could recognize him...I don't know. I'm kind of at wit's end here. His name is so common as well, so just googling him didn't do me any good.

If you know a good website or another way to try and find him,please let me know!

Thank you in advance.

I plan on getting Invisalign when I graduate and have a more reliable income to pay for it

If I tell the orthodontist that I want to remove my braces will they give me a retainer?  

Can I even cancel my braces if the government is paying for them?  

And will I have to pay money to have them removed?

BODY: I'm thinking of dying my hair a dark mahogany or dark cherry red. I know red fades quickly, what does it look like when it's faded (because it's so dark.) I'm going to do permanent, so will it fade as fast? Pictures would be greatly appreciated!

TITLE:  I love sports, but should I join a team?
BODY: I love sports, weather it s watching or playing. My favorite is basketball, and that s what I m mainly asking about. 
Background; I ve been playing basketball since I could throw a ball over my head. It s always been there and it s super relaxing. Not to mention I can make a shot from almost anywhere. Sometimes even with my eyes closed.
I never had the chance to play any type of sport growing up until I got to 6th grade. I had never played on a team before and really the only reason they let me join was because without me, there wouldn t have been enough players. I was really good after I figured out how to play with others.
Here s my problem; I moved to a new school in the eighth grade. I tried out for the team...and didn t make it. The excuse was that I m too slow. It didn t matter that I could make a shot 146 times in a row (true story.)
Now I m a Senior in High School. I haven t played on a team since seventh grade at my old school but I play by myself constantly and am a lot faster. Here s the catch; anyone can join the high school team. They don t turn anyone away. However, because I haven t played for the school, I have a feeling I ll be put on the JV team with the eighth and ninth graders. Reason I m skeptical; Yes I love basketball and will do anything to play...even being on JV my Senior year. However, I m already getting bullied as it is and don t really want comments aimed at my bball skills. So should I join and risk getting laughed at? Or keep playing by myself?

BODY: Okay so let me explain, I'm not trying to be rebellious or anything..

Well a couple nights ago, my ex called me and told me that she was pregnant for about two months but ended up being a miscarriage...

Although the gender was undetermined we both agreed that we would have wanted it to be a girl so we named her Zoey... And with all this time to think, I've been wanting to get her name tattooed on the center on my chest in honor for Zoey.

I ask this because I know my parents would NEVER go through with this.

TITLE:  My mother wont clean my turtle tank?!?
BODY: So I've had a turtle for a year now, and cleaning her tank has been just a chore normally.  It has not been a big deal.  

For the past three months my mother refuses to help me clean my turtle tank!  She says no and the turtle has had to have it's rock removed because it was getting too big for the tank.  It is puke green and filthy!  Now she sleeps on a plastic bowl in the tank.  I know what you guys might say, "Why don't you just do it?"  It's because I am a petite girl and I cannot lift the tank.  I can do everything else but just need help lifting it.  

Should I get rid of the turtle and give it a better home?  Should the turtle just live in the filth?  What should I do please help!!

TITLE:  My new kitten is hissing at my dog, what can I do?
BODY: My family has never owned a cat and we just rescued a kitten about 5-days ago from the shelter. She was rescued from under a trailer the day before. We have a 3-year-old snorkie (Yorkie/mini schnauzer) who we have kept separate, only introducing them through a crate for the past 5-days. Today we finally allowed them a face-to-face encounter and they did great. We gave them both treats as they sniffed and got to know one another without hissing, biting, or barking. Our dog wanted to play, she didn't understand that Harper was just a baby. Harper would just stare at her like she was crazy. They've gotten along well all day. They both took a nap on my lap this evening and Harper even went to Macie and was rubbing her face up against her. Then earlier Macie walked over to her and Harper arched her back and started hissing like crazy. I yelled for Macie to get back out of fear for her getting an eye scratched out. Now Harper is hiding. I don't have much experience with cats, but we already love Harper. Any reason why she had this reaction? Any tips or ideas to remedy this issue? I had a bad experience when I was a teen with a cat and I've honestly been scared of them for over 15-years, but I love our new kitty and I don't want this to scare me too out of fear she'll hiss and scratch me.
Thanks in advance for your help. 😊

TITLE:  Nervous for eye doctor appointment tomorrow:/?
BODY: I'm going to the eye doctor for the first tomorrow and I'm really nervous. I'm 18 and have never gone. My moms taking me because I've been telling her for years that I want to get my eyes checked but I suddenly feel like they're fine and I really don't want to go. I don't want to go and nothing be wrong with my eyes and then my mom laugh at me and I'll look like an idiot for complaining. I feel like I need glasses but I dont know. I guess I can see things far away but when it comes to stuff like reading street signs when I'm in the car, I can't see them until after I cross the cross walk. If any sort of writing is moving at all, I can't read it. I can't focus on it. Also I can't read without getting double vision. Like my eyes will focus and then unfocus and keep doing this. I definitely can't see signs at night because of the glare. I have no problem seeing objects but words are really hard to see. Right now I'm on my phone and I have my phone really close to my face. It's still slightly blurry but I can read it. Is this normal? I'm nervous for tomorrow and would just like to have an idea on what might happen.

TITLE:  I seem to have gotten my kitten into thinking my arm is a toy. Would putting lemon/lime juice on my arms be okay?
BODY: My little kitten has me a bit smitten. She loves playing with my arms, as in scratching and bitting. Because she is so small, it doesn't really hurt necessarily but it isn't exactly pleasant either. I'm thinking putting something sour on my arms will cut her habbit of chewing my arms. I know some people let their cats play with their hands like that but I'm afraid that when she gets older, and has a stronger bite and bigger claws, she will continue bitting. I'm wondering if I need to get rid of that habbit at all? I feel like I should but I need a second opinion. And as for the lime juice, would that be safe?

TITLE:  My gums hurt?
BODY: Okay so , I've had sore gums for maybe a few days now, but not throughout my mouth, just on my bottom jaw on the right side, right under two teeth who have been hurting as well. Now the flesh isn't like full of fuss or whatever, but it is a wee bit more reddish than the rest, a bit more hard and certainly sore. I can feel it when I move that part of the face, my cheek or open my mouth widely, and also when I touch it, the stuff hurts. 
I'm wondering if this is caused by the two teeth who have also been causing me aches, and if this is something kind of common to happen, or something a bit more serious. The reason I'm asking is that the place I'm in right now isn't an area that has a dentist nearby, since I'm on vacation and I wonder if this situation is urgent and should be looked at straight away.

How is his hair cut? I was thinking of leaving my top hair like it is, but going a bit shorter on the sides. Would it look good?..

BODY: A couple of months ago my mothers partner moved in with his pet Bearded Dragon, Asbo. I was told she was very quiet and more often than not kept to herself unless she is ready for feeding. This is a pet I have always wanted so I often sat next to the vivarium. Recently whenever I have been in the room she has gotten..'excited?' and has wanted to be let out. This doesnt occur with anyone else nor her main owner- the guy that has had her since hatching.  This is unusual for her and it makes me wonder if she likes me or not. ^-^

BODY: Zero, the mother, had 7 babies. Daisy and Miracle are numbers 2 and 7 and they are the only two that haven't died yet. We've kept them wrapped up in a clean baby diaper to keep them warm, and we've been bottle feeding them kitten formula. My mom gave me a heat lamp to keep them under with a wash towel separating them from the light. They're laying on a bed of socks. I'm really scared one or both of them won't make it. Daisy skin is red/pink and Miracle's is purple. Any suggestions?

BODY: The arguments are protecting ethnic russians (which make up the majotiry of the population), "will of the people" referendum.

And what was a real reason for it?
This is my read: Historically, it was a disputed territory, it was mostly controlled by russians and, in their words, was just recently "gifted" to Ukraine (in the chaos associated with the end of USSR). And now they're branding that transfer unconstitutional. At least that's what I hear. Now that Ukraine refuses to be in the russian bloc, naturally they'd want it back.

TITLE:  What is wrong with my cat?
BODY: I am getting really worried about my cat I have had her for over 3 months now and she doesn't seem to want to come out her shell. She is always hiding away and if we aren't in the house she will find a way to get under my bath or in a drawer somewhere. She will only ever come out from her hiding places when its like 2 o'clock in the morning and by that time I am usually asleep so I don't know what she gets up to. She is only 4 years of age and she is the size of a kitten, she doesn't really eat much I have been told by the vet she is seriously underweight and I have tried my hardest to get her weight up but she turns her nose up at everything I give her..the only thing she will eat is a bannana if I am munching it she will just come over and steal it from me. She is very timmid aswell and will never play. She just stays hiding away in a cornor. I do go over and pick her up and she would just love sleeping on me or by my side but I would need to bring her over to do it. Any ideas on what I can do to get her out her shell and to eat?

TITLE:  Relaxed hair changing texture from straight to wavy?
BODY: Forgive me if this sounds a bit ill versed, but I have been getting my hair chemically relaxed since I was about 11, so roughly 5 years now. Over the years I've noticed that when I first began getting the treatments, my hair was bone straight, and now, especially closer to the roots, my hair is much thicker, and more textured than the ends. The area of hair that I'm talking about is a different texture than my new growth completely so I'm rather confused about this. Could it be that my hair is over processed (what does over processed hair look and feel like)? Or could it be that my hair no longer takes to the relaxer as it used to? When my hair is wet, my new growth is curly, and the "random section" is thick and wavy. I guess overall, I want to know if this is a sign of over processed hair. Thanks in advance. Also, I have started to stretch my relaxers to 2-3months rather than the 8 weeks suggested. If that makes any difference.

TITLE:  When did my 18 weeks start?
BODY: I saw my GP back in March about a problem with my hip. He referred me to my local hospital to see a consultant. I was sent for an MRI and the consultant then referred me on to a second consultant at a different hospital. I have now been told I need an operation on my hip, but the waiting list of full until the middle of next year. 
I have been advised that there is a part of the NHS constitution that states treatment should be started within 18 weeks of being referred, but would my clock have started in March when my GP initially referred me, or in May when the first consultant referred me to the second consultant? 
I would not usually complain about our brilliant NHS, but I'm in a lot of pain and I'm beginning to have trouble walking, would like to get my problem sorted sooner rather than later.  Any advice welcomed.

I also have the BenQ XL2420T 120Hz 24.0" Monitor which I do not intend on replacing. 

I've been looking on the internet and some people say anything above the GTX 970 is overkill for 1080p gaming but I have been hearing about performance issues with the 970. 

Please help me decide if I should look into the 980 or even the 980 ti.

They say I get $20/hr and I don't even have experience but they say there's training.  Is this a scam or legit?

This is one of my first times getting a bird, but I have a good amount of experience with birds, my aunts and cousins have had birds in the past that I was able to handle and all sorts, one time I even baby sat 2 for a week which was fun. I can cleanup after them, and have had many other experiences with other animals, so I don't think being a "beginner" is the issue. I just don't know which one I should get, maybe some pros and cons would be appreciated. Or maybe even some personal experiences or preferences :)))))). I also do understand most can live 15+ years and I'm willing to commit to the bird.

I looked at my earnings today and it just popped into my head. I might have clicked an ad on my mobile version of my site yesterday, but honestly I cannot remember if it did anything when I clicked on it.

So I am unsure if the click was from me or a viewer (I am obviously in the realm of 1 to 2 clicks per day). Should I Just leave it alone, I heard google is not super up tight for a couple accidental clicks and this is the first potential one ever, and I am not even sure.

TITLE:  Cat ate small piece of yarn.?
BODY: My cat recently (within the hour) ate a piece of soft yarn about 6-7 inches long. He is acting fine and I can not see any yarn in his throat. I am wondering what would be the best option to do. I understand there are risks for this kind of stuff and I know what could possibly happen. I talked to a few vets already and they recommend calling an emergency animal hospital. I did and they said to bring him in to try to induce vomiting since that is the only real thing you can do right now. Obviously they recommend that but is this necessary or should I just wait it out to see if he poops it out/throws up?

He is a maine coon so he has long hair and gets hairballs a lot. I was wondering if the yarn would have the same effect as his hair since he has hair as long as the piece of yarn. Is it ok to give him food?

BODY: I have worked at this company for two years and I was recently called into my bosses office.  He began to tell me that he needed my Facebook password and I asked him why he needed my password.  He then replies that "somebody in this company may be leaking confidential information through Facebook and we need to look at all of our employees social media profiles to see who is doing this." I then told him that it was not me (It was not because I never talk about work on Facebook).  Furthermore, I told him that I would not be handing over my Facebook password to him.  He then tells me that this makes me suspicious and that the company may terminate me for insubordination if I refused to hand over the password.  I replied that I was still standing firm and was not going to hand over my password.  As of today, I still have a job.  Did I make the right decision and should I begin looking for another job?

TITLE:  Is there a rule of thumb to reduce or prevent "getting out of shape" when slowing down workouts?
BODY: This could entirely be in my head too, but just curious. 

Last March I could barely run 200yds before my knees/back hurt. Training 6 days a week, running, cycling, swimming, mountain biking, and gym strength, I have now raced in 6 foot races (5k-10k) and a triathlon. 

I still work out 6 days a week, but I want to focus more on cycling and strength. My fear however, is how fast I may lose my running fitness. After all, running shape was the hardest to improve for me. 

Cutting running back to maybe once a week, but still maintaining heavy cardio via cycling/mountain biking for heart/lung, would that potentially avoid any reduction of running strength?

TITLE:  I got into a car accident last week and...?
BODY: So my friend (18 years old) was driving and I (17 years old) was in the passenger seat. She was driving like average speed and she looked away for ONE second and the next second we crashed into a tree. It was pretty bad and The airbags did not go off and I jerked forward pretty hard but didn't hit anything. When all the trucks and stuff got to us, they were all asking us if we were okay. My friend hit her head on the steering wheel and she had a mild headache and we told the people that and they asked if we wanted to go to the hospital but we said no because we thought it was too dramatic because we felt absolutely fine. So we did not visit the hospital that day. When my mom got home, which was about 8 pm, I told her about the accident (I thought it was okay to tell her later so she wouldnt worry at work, and since I was fine I didn't call) and she told me I should've went to the hosptial to get a check-up and I regretted not calling her ever since. I should've just let her know but idk why I didn't. My dad told me he got into an accident a long time ago and his neck hurt ever since. I am worried that there might be something wrong with me (i'm feeling fine though). Also, if I had gone to the hospital that day, would check ups would've been free? If I go now, a week later after the crash, for a check up, would it cost a lot of money?
btw if i get treatment (even though it's more than 72 hours) will insurance companies help me out?

TITLE:  Fish help! Please he might be sick.?
BODY: I have convict cichlids. Yesterday I switched them to a bigger tank. I was expecting some stress as there always is but not from Lancelot. He s the alpha and never had a problem in his life. When I put him in the tank he was fine then gradually began to swim around the heater. I assumed he was just cold (the water temp is no different then the other tank). He would go so far as to put his face and body on the heater. The other fish seemed fine. This morning when I fed them he didn t eat. Which is especially unusual because he is always the first to eat. He swam in one spot and his face looked white. My first thought was burns from the heater. Until I noticed a bright white spot just under his left fin. It s ringed in red. I m not sure I this is just a bad burn or something worse.

Because I kind of like my gold undertones, but how would I do a paler version of that?

But if it helps I look best in best in pastels like light blue and pink. I have blue eyes. In my opinion I look less in attractive in darker colors like black, dark gray and brighter colors such as red or darker blue etc etc. will dying my hair darker help me pull of those colors? Still look good in lighter colors? I'm asking by dying my hair darker will I have to change my wardrobe?

BODY: currently im taking 40mgs of flouxetine... or Prozac a day for my depression but i heard that it caused hairloss....

Right now im taking  a hair skin an nail supplement by naturemade that includes 5000 mcg of biotin.

My hair hasnt really ever grown past my armpits and it want longer hair. im afraid the prozac will make me lose hair.

Im also taking msm. usually used fr jint pain and stuff. i heard it lengthens your growth period. i just need advice. would this work? i know everyones body reponds differently to the medication..

I'm too embarrassed to go to the shop by myself and buy makeup, I'm too embarrassed to ask my Mum to come with me and if my Dad ever seen me wearing makeup I would feel like killing myself, he hasn't actually come straight out and said he doesn't want me wearing it but I think he'd hate it. I feel so stupid, I'm supposed to be an adult but I feel so socially behind because I've had anxiety and depression for almost 10 years. I feel weak that I live my life for other people but I can't change. I feel so trapped and controlled.

So I was wondering if anyone knew of any Michigan winter guard (January-April) competitions that I could enter myself in as a solo act where I pick my song and choreograph it all myself.  Does the Michigan Color Guard Circuit have something like this? Is it too late to join? What would something like this cost?

TITLE:  Will my hair turn into a green, grey, and black disaster?
BODY: Hello
Recently I lightened by hair which is naturally dark brown. The results were awful, the top of my head down to the top of my ear is almost orange looking while the hair from the ear down to the middle of my  back is light blonde mixed with red toned spots. 
I purchased L'oreal black sapphire because I loved blue black on my mom. Her hair was black but the greys shined this electric blue in the sun. The box says to wait 14 days after bleaching or lightening.

It's been 14 days now but I'm worried my hair may turn green and grey on the lighter areas and black on the orange red areas. 
Is there a chance this will be a huge disaster? 
Could my hair turn all these different shades? Green black and grey.
I so no ash word on the box but it's blue black. 
If so why did it color my mom's grey hair that incredible blue? 
I'm asking for help because I don't want to be walking around for weeks looking like a clown haha.

TITLE:  Gmail isn t letting me switch accounts.?
BODY: I have been trying to change the email address linked to my google account from this one to a new gmail account. I had tons of trouble trying to set up a new email address, everything from errors and crashes and everything. It really ticked me off. Anyway in the end I wrote random words because everything else wasn t working and I was trying to see if this way would. Well wouldn t you know it did, great. Now I attempted to change the email address but the only way to do that was to delete it, which I did. BUT NOW ITS SAYING I CANT CHANGE MY EMAIL ADDRESS UNTIL I DELETE IT. I DID DELETE IT!! Ive been trying to fix this for hours and I m getting really ticked off because all I wanna do is get a new email address for my business and it won t let me sign up for a new email on this account. And no I cant create a completely new google account. Does someone know what to do. Thank you in advance.

TITLE:  PC "revving" up?
BODY: Couple of times a week, the processor on my PC sounds as if it is revving up. I am saying it is the processor because I don't know what it is.     I don't know if it is updating or what.  It whines and stops, whines and stops.  There is about 5 seconds between the whines. The PC works as well as it ever has with no problems.  It is a Dell Inspiron running Windows 7.

thanks

TITLE:  Do I have to allow my new kitten to roam my whole house?
BODY: I am soon getting a new cat, and I'm also moving. Our new house has an upstairs and a downstairs. My room is upstairs. There are three bedrooms upstairs. I was hoping to let my future cat to be able to roam the whole house and explore, but my brother has 3 daschunds... One of them is aggressive towards small animals (she once tore the ear off of my brother's rabbit, but it lived) and would easily devour the kitten. The other dogs play way too rough. We're keeping them downstairs at all times... So now I'm thinking just keeping the cat upstairs at all times, where the dogs can't get. It's a large space and she'd have access to all rooms. Would that be okay? Also, I'm taking the cat shortly after I get her/him to the vet to get her/his shots. Should I get the kitten spayed/neutered, even though I'm not going to let it be an outside cat? Should I get it microchipped, also? It won't be allowed outside. Thanks!!!

Apparently, they aren t very noticeable because no one in my family has said a thing, including my parents. However, I would still want to do a remineralization treatment with a doctor. Should I tell my parents that I have these spots or do I wait until I am on my own? How would I even tell my parents?

TITLE:  Poem, help?
BODY: So im trying to brainstorm some topics to write a Humorous Poem. It has to be about an everyday task.
I picked the topic of changing my duvet :) HEre is m poem, does anyone have any changes to make to it? Help? I need to make sure it is worthy of an A :)

Title: My Duvet

Duvet, duvet, what shall I do with my duvet?
I try to change it, but it just won’t stick!
It slides to the right so I pull it to the left.
It hangs to the ground at the end of my bed so I pull it up.
Now I notice it’s inside out, and upside down! 
Now it’s hanging from my ceiling!

“Duvet, duvet, please come down!”
I straighten it out just so, what a task!

Now to make sure it stays I must tuck the corners
I tuck in the right front corner and the back right corner.
Oh no! It has untucked itself and now is on the floor!
Will I ever be able to get my duvet to stay? Even if just for the day?

TITLE:  Force in a golf swing? How much to use?
BODY: After countless hours of dissecting my golf swing following a horrible round last weekend (I'm not the best golfer to begin with, but far from the worst), I think I'm starting to get an idea of what the problem might be. I think my problem is that I'm trying to "hit" the ball, rather than "swing" swing at it. My question is; should I be putting any force at all into my swing, or letting the weight of the club on the downswing do ALL of the work. My tendency (especially with irons where I need a lot of work) is to come down over the ball, striking the top of the ball and making it bounce either straight up maybe twenty feet out, or a shot that skips like a rock on a pond. I just can't seem to get over this. Any advice is extremely appreciated. 10pts for best answer.

When I put he in the cage she examined it and has been eating/nibbling it for a few minutes, but its making me nervous because on the back it says "seek immediate veterinary care if your pet consumes the bedding" is small print on the back. Is it normal for them to do that after a switch, or should I just stick with what she normally uses? URGENT SHE NEEDS HER CAGE

TITLE:  POLL: Do you think I should have long hair or short hair?
BODY: I recently got my haircut from shoulder-length hair to chin-length. I was originally going to get it cut short, but at the time I was extremely indecisive about it, so I decided to play it safe and only get a trim. 

Now I'm starting to think I should get it cut shorter again. 

What do you think: Do I suit long hair or should I cut it shorter?

Thanks. :)

I don't know why there are software conflicts, on a device that was supposed to come with this software.

I am running on an MSI laptop, and all of the added software that came with this PC really doesn’t add to the functionality of the device.
Any idea on how to get my headset working? 

I have had this problem since day 1, and I have had the laptop for 2 years.

I will happily provide any additionally needed information.

TITLE:  Curly hair help?
BODY: So, I naturally have really curly hair and I love it but the other day, I noticed a section that was heat damaged and it was almost just completely straight. I straightened it in May for my graduation and I even used a heat protectant that was supposed to be really good. Also, my ends have been dry and I'm really trying to hold back from chopping my hair off. I'm trying to grow it out. Can anyone recommend any products that would help with dryness and possibly heat damage? I just need something really moisturizing. I don't like to use anything that has silicon, sulfates, or parabens in it. I know that Mixed Chicks is good but it's just so expensive.. I currently use the Cantu Coconut Curling Cream and thats the only thing I put in my hair after a shower and it works wonders and makes my hair real curly. I also do an oil treatment once a week. I don't understand why my ends are so dry? I just want to have healthy bouncy curly hair. Am I doing something wrong? I dye my hair red every 3 or 4 months just to refresh the color. Is that it why my hair is dry?

Also, I don't wash my hair that often. I only wash it about once or twice a week but other then that, I just "wash" it with conditioner. I use the Tressemé Flawless Curls line but would like to use something else because Tressemé has sulfates and silicons in it and what not..

If it helps, my hair texture is a mixture of a 3A and 3B

TITLE:  8 things to know about Bastille Day. Any thoughts?
BODY: The French people will be celebrating their national pride today, July 14th. But there’s more to France than the delicious macarons and nutella-filled crepes. Here are some facts about le fête nationale:

1. Bastille Day is celebrated annually on July 14th to commemorate the historical Storming of the Bastille.

The Storming of the Bastille took place during the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789. The 14th was also chosen because the following year, the French people celebrated the Fête de la Fédération, which was a day to commemorate the temporary unity of the French nation.

I am always in the top 5 for most wickets at club in a year because I get line and length and swing and seam etc. however I feel like I need to be quicker. I play Kent 2nd XI premier league cricket or Kent regional premier league cricket and most opening bowlers bowl 75mph minimum whereas I open the bowling at only 60-65mph. I feel like extra pace can really help me. I am 6ft3 which helps but still not very quick. Any tips to get quicker???

TITLE:  My cat inhaled water??
BODY: She was laying in the sink because she likes drinking out of running water, I went to turn it on (just a couple of drops at a time) and I guess she inhaled a bit. She snorted, shook her head and went back to drinking water like nothing happened, IF she did inhale anything it couldnt be more than a couple of droplets.
Will she be okay?? I heard water up cats nose can be dangerous. Its 3AM here and no emergency vets, vet opens at 9. Can anyone tell me what to do?? She drank her water, ate dinner and has been playing around as if nothing happened

TITLE:  Tiny scratch on tooth?
BODY: I have the tiniest scratch in front side of front tooth. Its actually invisible unless you shine a bright light onto it. It just looks like a faint white line. I never knew if I had this before but I just used a dental scraper and lightly scraped down my tooth and thats when I checked to see if it got scratched. That's when I saw it shining bright light onto it I dont know if that was same spot on tooth I scraped but I hope I didn't just do this. Do you think this was caused by this? Also, is this a problem having this scratch and what can I do about it?

TITLE:  My mom cut off my hair?
BODY: Ok so my mom asked me if I want my hair 'trimmed' mind you she has no hairdressing experience. She has been trying to get me to trim and relax my hair for ages now. I decided to go natural and she wasn't very happy about it she wants me to relax my hair. So I finally said she could trim my hair but not relax it. So she cut almost all my hair off. It used to be around my shoulders but now it's shorter than ear length. I so mad at her and I've spent the last 6 hours crying, she doesn't seem to care and I honestly think she did it on purpose so I would change my mind about going natural. I hate her so much right now and I'm going back to school in less than a month and I'm still new and I know everyone will make fun of me. What should I do?

TITLE:  Is there any way to tell if a dwarf gourami carries iridovirus?
BODY: I know its a long shot that you'd be able to tell before it actually got sick, but it's worth a try. About a week ago I bought a red fire dwarf gourami. He's really healthy, swims actively, eats like a pig. Obviously, so far there is nothing to worry about yet. I just found out how common it is for dwarf gouramis to carry iridovirus, and although he doesn't show any signs whatsoever of being sick, I'm still worried he carries it. Is there any way to tell? Thanks

TITLE:  My cat is always stressed and scared, any advice?
BODY: She's a Burmilla, about a year old. She's been spayed and living with us for almost 6 months or so, she'd be walking around or taking a nap on the floor and if anybody moves she'll run and hide. We got her a cat condo and placed it by the window, its gotten her to come out more. If someones been sitting in one place for a while she'll come up beside them, but the second they move she'll hide again. 
Due to stress her fur falls out a LOT, we groom her everyday but if she sits on the couch there will be a layer of fur on it, and she doesnt have any bold spots.
We've tried everything! If we have guests over she'd hide for hours after they've gone. Any advice? We've spoilt her with toys and treats yet she's sti scared of everything!

TITLE:  Pet fish issue?
BODY: My fish bumped into the side of the glass because she got excited, and now she scraped a bit of her skin on her gill. No blood or redness, so I don't think it really needs any medication, but I feel that maybe it might annoy her gills or something. Do I remove it with scissors or something?

TITLE:  Agree: Kyrie Irving is better than Stephen Curry?
BODY: Kyrie is better at every aspect and Kyrie doesn't hog the ball like Stephen curry does. Don't use the assists excuse because Kyrie doesn't run his teams offense, LeBron does. Kyrie is a 10x better defender he averages 3 blocks a game and Curry didn't even block a shot this season. Don't say Warriors won championship as an excuse because KYRIE and LOVE were out, if they played they would have won. Also Kyrie shoots better, has better handles, also, not saying this affects their game but Kyrie isn't a dick off the court like Curry is and isn't stupid enough to bring his 2 year old daughter into a PRESS CONFERENCE!

TITLE:  Ankle makes a popping sound?
BODY: I was in a splint for two weeks and in a hard cast for four weeks.  I had surgery on my ankle and had three anchors put in to hold my paroneal tendon in place.
I just got off my cast yesterday and I ve been having a popping sound when I walk on my foot now.  It comes from right behind my big finger and it only happens when I step high on it.  It hurts when I do this too so I can t run but I can walk perfectly fine.  
Is it normal for that to happen since I haven t been able to properly walk on my foot in five weeks or is something wrong with my foot?

TITLE:  Tattoo Artist asking for sexual favors?
BODY: I recently just started going to a new place for my tattoos. The artist I picked was very pleasant and professional. I felt completely at ease. He knew exactly what I wanted and I was very happy with the finished product. The price was $100 but I gave him $120. Later that evening he friend requested me on Facebook. I messaged him an hour later and we were kind of flirty. I told him my next tattoo idea and he said when he goes into work on Tuesday he will send me a picture of something he has that is similar. Well he messaged me this afternoon letting me know he was almost done with my drawing. He said it would be $350 but he could give me a really good discount. $80 for outline and $80 for color but I'll have to earn it by giving him blowjobs. I actually kind of like this guy and I'm very attracted to him. I'm just not sure how I should feel about this situation. Does this kind of thing happen a lot to females?

TITLE:  My Mbuna cichlid tank, w/quite aggressive cichlids &amp; was 'advised' to add a 'Red Devil!' After research, it's NOT GOOD- what do I do?!?
BODY: I have had Mbuna Cichlid tank for a year and a half now, but since they were juveniles we had a smaller tank with 2 cichlids- Melanchromis Aratus and a dark purplish w/dark disappearing vertical zebra type stripes with a yellowish Orange top edge of it's dorsal fin.ls our 'Mystery cichlid' purchased from an 'assorted tank' and we've yet to identify its speecies, Otherwise we have  a plecostomus in there, but that's it... we just upgraded to a 35 gal and I've been researching/looking for the best tank mates for our female Aratus, as they're quite aggressive and I don't want be adding expensive fish food, I want the additions to last and LIVE! I already had a few in mind and had to go get a few supplies for the tank- NO plans to buy any fish yet... but made the mistake of 'just looking' and got one Convict Cichlid and the girl suggested that a Red Devil would be good to go along with them. She seemed knowledgeable and I remembered seeing a Red something that was supposed to be a good match. Well, turned out it was a RED ZEBRA that I had looked up, so I decided to look up the Red Devil and see what I really got....  Ha, not even an African cichlid, it's a Central American, gets HUGE and said it'll basically gulp my fish up when it matures (it's a cute lil juvenile yet) and that it's definitely NOT COMPATIBLE with my Mbuna's. I love the way it looks n all now, and the Aratus doesn't even really go by it which I had thought was odd, UNTIL NOW! Now I just don't know what to do...!

Also, even though we,ve given her enough space to move around, she remains in a dark corner.

TITLE:  Help! What is the best contouring and highlight kit?
BODY: I've been looking all through out the Internet to find which one is the best one for me. I have acne prone skin so I need a kit that won't break me out. I have fair skin so I don't want anything too orange or too brown. I'm short on money right now so anything under 40 would be great. And if you any suggestions for what makeup brushes I should use, that would be really helpful. Thank you

TITLE:  Does anyone have any advice on how I should bath my cat...?
BODY: Hello! I need some help. I have this wonderful elderly cat that needs a bath. The problem however is that if she undergoes a great amount of stress her heart will basically have a blowout (those are indeed my veterinarian's words...). She has this condition known as hyperthyroidism and so in order to support her day to day activities she has to eat 3x what she used to eat. unfortunately while this extra intake of food makes her happy it also makes her quite smelly (imagine this: a mix of tuna smell, "turkey giblets and gravy pate", and other various canned meat cocktails.... definatly not smelling roses here) 

So basically what i need is a non-stressful, cat safe, EFFECTIVE way to bath my kitty. Any suggestions?

BODY: I know racism was not legal but I'm fairly certain it was still alive and well, right? As for gay men and women, how were they treated? I would like to know more about the Texas and Georgia states than the US as a whole but either way is fine. If you can be descriptive or maybe write some personal experience that would also be a huge help, thanks :)

BODY: I have a ball Python. Shes not very big, probably about 3/4 the length of my arm. I was just wondering what the laws are regarding her being with me in public. I see people all the time with their dogs everywhere, even at Walmart. idont really see a difference between dogs and my snake (Monty the Python) but im not sure if the laws feel the same. Honestly, Monty is safer than a dog. Ive actually been attacked by dogs in public. But I have had Monty for a few years, and she has never even struck at me

TITLE:  How can I convince my parents to ditch our cats now that our home has been such a mess?
BODY: I love cats, please don't get me wrong. It's just that we have TOO many of them (13 to be precise) and they bring nothing other than sh*t to our house. What can I do? It smells really bad and our house floor turns so really sticky. I'm sick of cleaning it every single time. Plus- unlike other kids who always ask their friends to come around and chill at their home, I was afraid and ashame to do that. Everytime we come to that kind of topic, I always try to dodge saying that "Oh guys, my room are such a mess. Still hasn't got time to clean it, so yeah next time ok," whilst the thing is, it is more worst than that. 

Yes, I've tried talking about this to my parents like so many times before but they didn't listen to me. They even got mad at me 'cause they still love 'em and don't have a heart to ditch all the cats on street. Yes, I know I should be more loving and just um.. what do I say- cleaning their sh*t without complaining bla bla bla but- until when? Until when can I stop my friends to come around? What will they think of me? When will I have such a good time living in my so-called-home if all the cats are still there torturing me around?

So if you guys do have a solution to this, PLEASE TELL ME- I'm begging hmm.

TITLE:  Why has my goldfish all of a sudden gotten lethargic?
BODY: I have three goldfish I bought a day ago, one is acting kind of slow,  it s pretty much just hovering in the middle of the tank, it does swim around just not real frequent, it s a fan tail goldfish if that s of any help.
   I feed high quality goldfish flakes and remove excess flakes after each feeding after a couple minutes pass, I feed twice a day. The fish have a fluorescent light on them during daylight hours and darkness during night time hours. 
   Is it possible my tank didn t cycle all the way through and is poisoning it or is this normal behavior? The other two fish are acting normal.. My water started to become cloudy this morning, 12 hours after putting the fish in the tank. I let the tank cycle approximately two weeks before buying any fish, it was a brand new aquarium. I have a water filter in the aquarium, which I ran the entire time I was cycling the tank, I also dechlorinated the water with the tetra water conditioner an hour to adding the fish. I let the fish float for an hour before setting them loose in the tank so they wouldn t go into shock from a major temperature change, they seemed to all be doing fine and now one of the fantails are acting unusual. I would appreciate any answers you could give me. I would hate to lose it over something that I am doing wrong.

TITLE:  Need advice on how to get my cat better aquatinted with my cousins kitten. I am having to watch while they are gone.?
BODY: My cat is around 2yrs old we got her from a shelter. She was a just recently a mama cat when we'd gotten her. She's been with us 6 months now and is a wonderful cat. 
My cousin just recently left with her hubby on a cruise. We have her kitten for 2 weeks. The kitten is only 10wks. I'd initially thought that my cat Callie would have done good with the kitten. But boy was I wrong. She does nothing but hisses at her and when the kitten does try to attempt to go around her, my cat acts as if she's going to eat her alive. I've managed to keep them separate through the night were no one is up to keep watch. But during the day its even crazy at times, just constantly being on alert. Is there anything I can do to get my Cat more use to the new kitten in the house? Is this normal cat behavior that mine is expressing? Thanks in advance.

TITLE:  Need help to convince my mom in getting me a cockatiel?
BODY: Hey,
My name is Diogo, today I'm here to ask for your help, so here's my story:
At the start of the summer I was on vacations with my brother and we were at his friend's house, he had a cockatiel, and I just fell in love with it, I mean I would do anything to have one. One week later when I got home I tried to get my mom to let me have one, I swore I would take care of it and would pay all the things it needed, but still she told me I couldn't have one because she doesn't want more pets in the house. I tried reasioning with her telling her that my brother got a a fish aquarium when he wanted to and that since we already have 2 little birds in the house we could just have another one, even if it was in my bedroom but she kept saying no. Please! I need help, I need steps on how to make her let me have it.

Ps: She's not the easy charmy type of mom.

Thanks!

BODY: Today I found a hummingbird that got its wing ripped off. It wasn't bleeding at all but it can't fly. I put it in a cage with some bedding and I've been feeding it sugar water with a syringe every few hours and it seems to be fine. It just stays in one spot and starts to freak out when people or animals come near the cage. Will it die without the wing? I don't think it's in shock but I have no idea. I also do not know how to prevent infection. Any advice will help. I just want him/her to live.

BODY: I just got a male betta fish from pet Co. I felt super bad for him cause you could just tell he was sad. When I brought him home and put him in the tank he would sink to the bottom then swim to the top for air. I took a closer look and saw his left gill was sticking out. Almost like he was fairing. He seems to be breathing verey heavily. I quarantined him to a tank with clean fresh water that I conditioned. Idk what to do I don t want him to die please help. He started swimming more when I put him in the empty tank. I m worried. I have another betta(in a separate tank of course) and he s super happy and healthy. Looking at this fella being sick kills me.

Are specific red shades harder to achieve doing it myself?

TITLE:  Need a Rustic show name[s]!?
BODY: Recently acquired a palomino paint mare, broodmare. Currently in foal to another palomino paint as well. Both mare and stud are in reining, minor reining for teenagers. The broodmare is as sweet as can be. They took to calling her Hoku, but I hate that name till all ends. No stupid names like Caroline, Sadie, etc. Or Indian names please, love them, but unless you can incorporate it into a good name, leave them out. We plan on using this mare in halter in three years time, and need to get her registered.

As for the foal, we are unsure if he/she will turn out to be a palomino, we think the shot is great.
Sire: Crazy but Lazy.
Please don`t incorporate his name into the foal`s name. Both mare and foal need a show name, Rustic/Cowboy type names are preferred/

TITLE:  Malnourished new kitten. Help!?
BODY: We went to the store and got a new kitten who looked lively and healthy when we got him. They told us he was eight weeks old and that he ate dry food. We tried to get him to eat dry food and he wouldn't eat it. he only ate a small amount of wet food that we gave him and then he threw it up. It took us a couple of days to realize he wasn't eating because he would put dry food in his mouth ( turns out he was spitting it out. ) Took him to the vet turns out that he is only six weeks! We have him on kmr, dry food with gravy on top, and a kitty supplement. He still only eats about 4 tbs of dry food a day ( he has been eating for four days now) and he still isn't  playing.  Is this normal?  How long until he starts gaining weight?

BODY: http://i.imgur.com/lCQcDoP.jpg

How do I explain the length and how to cut ? 
Don't want to show the picture or anything.
And do I have to use hair products like wax spray or anything ? It looks like his front hair is long but made it go side ways with wax or something.
Also want to get my eyebrow like him.
I got a thick brow. Do hair salon do eyebrows as well ? The problem is after few days it'll grow back and I don't know how to cut it back by myself. =[ Wouldn't shave it with razor right ?

TITLE:  I'm so terrified of my dentist appointment!?
BODY: I'm 17 years old and tomorrow is my first dentist appointment in almost 2 years (due to lots of moving, I wasn't able to make any appointments.) We are planning on staying here for a while, and my grandma has scheduled a dentist appointment for me tomorrow. In the past, I have been... Not so good to my teeth. I have a lot of cavities and holes in my teeth. I brush my teeth often, but I drank so much soda that my teeth are just rotting because of it. I now drink more water and juice and milk, but they're still very destroyed. They look horrible and I am so scared of what the dentist would say. Would it be possible to just ask the dentist to pull my teeth? I am so ashamed of them and I get made fun of sooo much for them, people asking me what's wrong with my teeth. Although I'm 17, would they maybe pull my teeth?

TITLE:  COMPUTER MIC PROBLEM- POSSIBLE AUDIO DRIVER OR SOUND CARD ISSUE?
BODY: Ok so i have an older computer. Its a dell OptiPlex 745.
 
im having an issue thats been driving me nuts for the longest time and i would be AMAZING for it can be fixed.
 BASICALLY. my issue is that no microphone works. I plugged it into the pink jack port and a mic port on the front. neither works. i noticed that if i yell into my mic it picks up the smallest amount of sound you can imagine. ive enabled mic boost. but still no help. the recording audio of my mic is so quiet. i tried different mics. one of the mics i tried is like a phone mic. it has a speaker too. when i tried that oddly the speaker was acting as the micophone. but still way to quiet. 
and another problem is that i tried several screen recording programs. but none will pick up audio.
so idk what to do. im used dells system detect thing and downloaded the recommended audio driver. which is , "SoundMax AudioESP". 
thats what im using. but oddly im having all these issues. i can hear audio. but just not record it and microphones dont work. maybe i need a new sound card? idek.. im not tech savy.

PLEASE HELP

TITLE:  Weird object emerging from scar tissue?
BODY: A little over a year ago I had an accident where a deep horizontal 6 inch laceration was formed below my knee over my patella tendon. I recovered well but after a couple months I noticed a weird foreign looking object emerging from the scar tissue. At first the object was deep down in the tissue and you could only feel it but after a few weeks it began to visibly Emerge breaking out of the tissue. The object was a small solid white chip of sorts about the size of a popcorn kernel. And this is a continuing issue for the same thing has occurred twice and another identical one is emerging. So If anyone could take a look at this info and let me know what you suspect it could be I would appreciate it.

TITLE:  The San Antonio Spurs and the 2016 NBA Championship?
BODY: I believe that San Antonio winning this championship with Lebron losing another Finals match up again the Spurs is a formality at this point.  GSW won't be defending that title.  They are pretty much bringing back the same core San Antonio has been piecing out since 2013.  Their days as Champions are numbered.  Houston is an inferior version of what GSW does on the court.  They made very little changes as well and I won't be expecting them to be a team that opens the 1st round of the playoffs with Homecourt.  Whatever problems San Antonio had with matching up with the Memphis Grizzlies has effectively been resolved with the signings of Aldridge and West.  A serious upgrade when comparing Duncan being forced to rely on the mentally weak Splitter.  The match up just got even tougher for the Clippers, who needed 7 games to beat the Spurs.  They stayed the same while we upgraded.  Dallas will still be trash and most likely miss the playoffs or sneak in as an 8th seed.  Pelicans will still be too raw to make any serious type of push in the playoffs.  Portland has been wiped off the map without even needing to see a game played. There is only one team that I will be worried about, and that is the Oklahoma City Thunder.  Durant and Westbrook will be back, together and healthy,ready to destroy any team that attempts to stand in their way.  At full strength, they will be a nightmare matchup for any team in the league.

The jars were warm and I thought id put them in this ice bag to cool them off. I just got to my destination a few days ago and when I went to use one of them, its a water based pomade by shear revival. Its not cheap **** the jar cost $20. It wouldnt hold at all. And I got a haircut recently so shouldnt it hold even more? My hair is fairly long but thats never been a problem. All the pomade did was make my hair greasy and had no volume. Ive never had this problem before and I was wondering is it because of the conditions I put them in? And should I just buy new ones now?

TITLE:  Does my betta have fin rot?
BODY: I have been noticing that my betta's tail is becoming shredded, I have been treating him with aquarium salt but I'm not sure if it is fin rot. If it is fin rot please recommend medications for me to use. He lives in a 2.5 gallon heated tank and I had a filter be very recently took it out because he doesn't like it. I attached a picture of him below. This is the best one I could get because he doesn't stop swimming.

TITLE:  Yellow Belly Slider care?
BODY: While I was in Florida a few days ago I purchased two Yellow Bellied Hatchlings. I've been doing plenty of research for the care of them. At the moment they are in a 10 gallon tank with a2 inches of water with a Rock for the dry spot. I have a heat lamp over them for them to bask. This is just temporary until tomorrow when I can go to the pet store. I was wondering what could I feed them when they're this young? I've been feeding them small pellets but can I feed them strawberries at their young age? And what are the neccesties I should purchase for them?

BODY: APPROPRIATE Jazzy, sassy, girly and cute songs for a High School dance team! Preferably with lots of high and low points and a really strong backbone. Big Spender (Peggy Lee) is cute but it's repetitive and a little too inappropriate. We've done Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend (Moulin Rouge) and that was my FAVORITE of all time. Can be "sexy" but nothing talking specifically about sex or drinking.

BODY: She has never done this before. She started licking the same spot on my dads side of the bed, every time we brought her into my mom and dads bed room. It's the same spot every time, and she keeps licking it until there is a wet spot. She has been this for a few days now. Today, with out any warning, she suddenly peed on the spot she usually licked. I don't know why she has been doing this, and I don't know how to make her stop. She has been spayed for five months now, and she has had no trouble at all in using her cat litter. Can someone please explain to me why she is doing this, and how to make her stop? She is no longer allowed in my parents bedroom because of the peeing. Please help me. Thank you.

TITLE:  How much could sell my horse for?
BODY: I own a lovely tri-coloured 7yo 14.2hh ISH x mare but I'm starting to out grow her, I know I'm going to have to sell her but I have no clue how much for. 

I broke this mare from scratch so I know her exactly. She's got brilliant ground manners and could be handled by a small child. She falls asleep for both vet and farrier. 

At the time of sale she would have done- 
Eventing up to 1m (possibly affiliated) 
Competed 1.20/1.10m BSJA 
Trained to Medium level of dressage and competed to elementary. 
Done lots of Pony Club stuff including camps. 

She also is totally bombproof on hacks and goes over water and motorway bridges. She goes alone and in company and escorts the young spooky horses out on hacks. 

I can do nothing with her for a week then jump on her with just a head collar and leadrope as well. 

I think she'd be best going to a competition home with a young teenager that would have fun with her. 

How much do you guys think I'd get? She'll be around 8 or 9 at the time of sale.

TITLE:  PC screen turns off randomly after several days of use and takes a while before it will turn back on. I don t think its the vga cable??
BODY: I have a weird problem that I have never seen before that happens to my computer all the time.  Randomly my pc screen will go blank but the tower is still on and so I mess with the VGA cable and nothing happens.  I will turn the tower off and back on and still nothing.  Then I open the tower and push on the different wires and where the VGA cable connects and I try to power on and still I get nothing.  Then I disconnect all wires and cables and unplug wires from the motherboard and plug everything back in and finally the screen registers.  I ve repeated this same scenario many times and I can t figure out what is going wrong.  The PC is left completely alone and after about a week or two it turns off until I repeat the process.  The length of time between when it decides to shut off varies.  I m confused.  Could it be the video card going out or could it have something to do with one of the drives???

TITLE:  Would it harm my crickets if the bin is unorganized?
BODY: The bin my crickets are in is a weird shape so the egg carton and cardboard rolls don't fit evenly. IMO they seem to like the messiness of the hiding places. I had to take them out of the tank they were in because I needed it for one of my leopard geckos. There's about 1000 crickets in the bin. 

Would it harm them if I left the cardboard messy and not stacked or anything like I did? I feed them leftover veggies from my bearded dragons salad, I used to have little bowls for the veggies but I don't want to use them anymore. Could I just toss that in everyday instead of taking time to clean the bowls and fill them?

TITLE:  Random sharp lower back pain?
BODY: Yesterday I was bending over to pick up my puppy and before I got to picking her up, I felt a sharp pain in my lower back. It's been hurting sense yesterday and the sharp pain comes back whenever I stand too long. The pain travels through the sides of my hips into my side thighs. I've already tried icing, resting, and heating but neither have done the job. I'm only 17 and 5'7 135 pounds so I'm confused what is causing this... It's almost unbearable to walk. What could this be? What can I do to fix it? Would you suggest a doctor?

TITLE:  Do any of you folks know what a poet is?
BODY: My closet has a sackcloth shirt;
I have a crown of thorns.
My fingernails are lined with dirt;
My shoes are old and worn.
And all my efforts I exert
To write, not blow my horn,
Am I a poet?

Not me, I’m an aristocrat;
I dress in silk and gold.
I sneer beneath my velvet hat
At peons in my fold.
My every word deserves éclat,
My thoughts should be extolled!
Am I a poet?

My world is tilted, on a slant,
And dusty souvenirs
Are rapturous; I’ll even grant
I’m given hidden ears
To which they speak, although I can’t
Tell you. I’ve tried for years…
Am I a poet?

TITLE:  Are my wisdom teeth growing in?
BODY: I'm a 13 year old girl (I'll be 14 this September) and today I happened to notice a pain in my gums behind one of my molars. When I used a flashlight to look, I saw a little piece of a tooth growing in. I'm pretty sure that my 12 year molars have already grown in because I had teeth growing in when I was 12-13. I counted how many flat teeth I have (aka the teeth I use to chew with) and I have four on each side of my jaw, top and bottom (so basically 8 total on the top and 8 on the bottom) Are these my wisdom teeth? Sorry if I was confusing.

TITLE:  Are my wisdom teeth growing in?
BODY: I'm a 13 year old girl (I'll be 14 this September) and today I happened to notice a pain in the bottom of my jaw on the left side and right. When I used a flashlight to see what the problem was, I could see the corner of a tooth growing in only on the left side, but one is trying to poke through on the right. I'm pretty sure that my 12 year molars have already grown in because I can remember having molars growing in when I was 12-13. I counted how many flat teeth I have (aka the teeth I use to chew with) and I have four on each side of my jaw, left and right, top and bottom (basically 8 total on the top and 8 on the bottom, if that made any sense) Also, there doesn't seem to be any room behind this tooth growing in. Is it a wisdom tooth? I'm sorry for the length of the question and if there was any confusion.

BODY: Hi! I need to find this poem but I don't know what poem it is.

It's about this man who is slowly dying and he begins to see death. Death is personified to be his friend that is helping him . There is a part where it states something like "flowers bloomed" because the poem is demonstrating how we should't fear death rather be accepting of it.
I read it back in my AP Lit class but I honestly can't remember the author or title of the poem.

BODY: “Requiescant in Pace”

I thought of you today,
the yellow, crumpled leaf,
the silent, small black box reminding me
how suddenly it came,
announced in screeching tires and anguished screams.
I sprinted to the scene
of carnage on a nearby street, becoming
part of the curious ring
of onlookers.
Moans spread through the throng as
She approached,
Madonna of the Salvages and Sunken,
shrunk down to the shoals,
cradling, caressing, reassuring 
her son, head half-torn-away,
deliverance was at hand. 
I didn’t know
the tide that spread,
running past while pooling at my feet
would be this red or vast. 
I didn’t know
how little was required to drown.

In my opinion it kind of looks like a burn, it s oval shaped, on the thin part that you see if you lift your tongue, not the top or the bottom but the other part (I m not familiar with names, sorry) and it s not white but it s not yellow either, it s some type of injury color. I d attach a picture, but I don t know kf that s possible &amp; I m on mobile.

TITLE:  High quality/professional bleach for hair??
BODY: I've bleached and dyed my hair many many times, and I'm planning on bleaching and dying it again. The issue is, the bleach never fully bleaches my hair to a blonde/platinum blond color. It always comes out patchy. Some areas are so blond its white, some are a light or dark brown, some are a strawberry blond, and some are orange. I sorta need a platinum blond for the color im planning on doing (either pastel pink or pastel purple.) And I really want a great bleach to use. Please and thank you! c:

TITLE:  Any tips for growing out hair?
BODY: Now that I have gotten you lovely ladies attention I would like to elaborate that I am looking for anything I'm missing.  For the past 6 months I've been growing out my hair doing every hair growth tip:

avoid sugar/eat minimal sugar each day
egg/avacado hair masks
i never use heat
avoid the sun or wear hats when outside
take biotin/omega 3
eat healthy
i drink lots of water
get plenty of rest
exercise
brush my hair 3-5 times a day
I dont put it in tight ponytails

I feel like I might be missing something since my hair is definitely growing but not enough to my liking.

Any advice?

TITLE:  I think I got head lice?
BODY: About two weeks ago, I started to feel that there are things crawling in my hair. I don't know if its lice. I never share anything with anyone, nor have I come close enough (I think). Even when I seat in public seats, I never lay back my head so it doesn't touch anything. I didn't know where I would get it as I shower everyday (it doesn't matter anyway, they like clean hair too). Until today, I noticed my tutor was itching his hair. So it gotta be the only way I would have got it. I am not 100% sure that I have lice. No one checked my hair yet. But I can see white things in my hair (not sure if its dandruff). And I can't ask anyone to check it for me, I am not a kid and this would be really embarrassing.

TITLE:  Lorikeet necropsy revealed a glob of fluff/thin hair?
BODY: Recently, my Goldie's Lorikeet became mysteriously sick with no visible cause. We took him to the vet and they gave us some antibiotics as he had some sort of bacteria in his poop, but a few days later he passed in his sleep. After a necropsy was performed, we discovered there was a lot of thin, hairlike fluff, all rolled up into a ball in his gut, and that this was the cause of death. We have no idea where the fluff came from, but are thinking it could be from carpet, his rope-toys, or the paper towel bits I would tie to his cage for him tear at.

 Has anyone had this happen to them before, and if so, what caused it? Is there any way to prevent it? It was incredibly unexpected and shocking as he was in the picture of health, then suddenly became lethargic, slept a lot, and didn't talk for about 2 weeks before passing. I've seen so many birds with paper-towel bedding, rope toys, so it's very frustrating and confusing how he died.

 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I d like to find something that I can train in without adding too much more strain to my knee when I do things like lunges or long distance running.

Does anyone have any recommendations?

TITLE:  Is my kittens spay site infected?
BODY: I adopted my kitten, River, from a humane society on Sunday. She is just over 2 months old and was spayed this last Friday. Their vet checked her spay site before we took her home and said it looked fine, but I ve been concerned about it. It was looking fairly red and had a small gap, I sent a picture of it on Tuesday to my cousin who works in the vets office, and she said it looks ok but to watch it. 
Well today I wasn t too worried and was home all day with her. We played some this morning but she slept most of the day. I was worried about her being so tired so I looked at it again a little while ago and it looks like it is pussing, but I can t tell if it is from the scab coming off or not. 
I live in a small town and our veterinarian is only part time so my parents haven t been able to get a hold of her, if we have to we can go to the town over pronto. 
Does this look like it should? It has been 5 days, she is eating and drinking fine by the way. And I haven t noticed her licking at it, besides normal grooming. She is still very affectionate.
Is there something I should put on it? Or should I not touch it at all.

TITLE:  Good products for my hair?
BODY: Hi :)
At the min I'm using Loreal professional shampoo &amp; conditioner for dry hair. I have longish curly hair and I do straighten it often. I use jojoba oil or olive rarely after washing and when it's dry I style it. Sometimes it lacks life and looks dull cos of straightening prob? Not sure. I guess I should leave it curly but I don't:) 
I am mixed race and my hair is similar to the lady on the right 
http://curlyhairvancouver.com/?doing_wp_cron=1437010420.6269330978393554687500

If I get my hair done in the salon it looks really nice, flowy (whatever tht mean lol) and soft but on my own it looks horrible. Any advise?

TITLE:  Prescription glasses for football?
BODY: I have a history with my eyesight in that I squint and my eyes go dry in the summer, my doc says its hay fever caused by a problem which caused me to have to get a plastic lense in my left eye ( born with a cataract or something).
When I was young I had glasses and the doc said I don't need them as such, they won't help my eyes, they'll improve vision but aren't essential, I got laser on my left eye and if I wear a contact lense my eyesight is improved immensely.
My eyes are also sensitive to light and get very dry and I'm looking into glasses for rugby and football so my eyes won't be blocked by tears/ too dry to see/ blinded in bright weather etc.
How do I go about this, do I go to an optition and see what they say or what?
And can I get glasses that stop wind getting at my eyes, dim the light and have lenses to improve my sight

I've wanted a corn snake for years now,,,but is it weird that im this way? am I still a snake lover if i kinda dislike the venomous ones? I adore the pet ones..and the nonvenomous wild ones...as i said before the venomous ones are fine,I wouldnt kill one or anything,,i just dont wanna be near them like most snake lovers would..nor would i hold one ever

TITLE:  My 5 month old kitten refuses to go to the bathroom! I tried everything. Someone help!?
BODY: My cat gave birth to 4 kittens. They all learned to use the litter box expect one. It will go on clothes,blankets anything besides litter. We gave that one away to my sisters best friend. She had it for about 1 month or 2. She can't deal with it anymore the kitten (is a female) is going to the bathroom everywhere else besides where she should be going She tried bunny litter, wee wee pads, she brought her to the vet the vet thought maybe she was born with a UTI infection, she ended up not have one. So apparently there is nothing wrong with her. When i used to have her she used to cry before she would go to the bathroom. I would pick her up and put her in the litter box when i knew she was about to go to the bathroom &amp; she would quickly jump out of it and go right next to it. I really need help to figure out what more there is to do. I don't want my sisters friend mother to give the kitten to a shelter. That would break my heart for the kitten to go there. I would take her back but my mother doesn't want her because she will pee/poop everywhere. The girl that has the kitten gave it to a man who wanted it/loves cats and returned it back to her because it was going to the bathroom everywhere! Like i said she is 5 months old. I love animals especially cats and I don't want this kitten going home to home I want my sister friend to be able to keep it. I want it to start going to the litter box. What do i do? The vet wasn't much help, all said was she doesn't have UTI/nothing wrong.

TITLE:  If the Rebel flag is raciest. Why did THOUSANDS of black soldiers freely join the Confederacy to fight against the Northerners.?
BODY: The blacks many times performed labor duties.  These duties were much like the ones blacks performed in WW 2.  They were "free"  then, but not good enough for a white mans army.
   Some were in battle even Gettysburg.  At the 50th reunion of the battle, White Tennesseans found out there black brothers were on straw mats.  They found them and had them share THEIR cots and tents.  Brothers in arms are brothers forever.

  Before making rash decisions on the flag, read the history of blacks in the Confederacy

TITLE:  Stray cat with fleas and or tapeworm?
BODY: I found a stray cat and fleas were definitely present.. hundreds were on the cat until I have him or her a very long flea shampoo bath. Now I think it's all gone. I can't see anymore. My biggest worry is two fleshy wounds with no hair are present on his or her back. It had little white worm things on it moving around and we removed every single one carefully. There were twenty or so flies following him until we killed them all. Do you think these were baby fleas, worms, or maggots. I fed the kitten the appropriate amount of tape worm medicine just in case.

TITLE:  I feel like one of my coils in braces is in wrong place? should i call orthodontist?
BODY: I went to the ortho today and they took out my wire and I had a coil in between 2 of my teeth and they put the wire back in and then the coil was placed a tooth over. Should I call the orthodontist to make sure it's suppose to be there? Because it was placed for more spacing and now since its a different place the space is starting to close. I'm a little worried and usually nothing like this happens to where I'm calling the orthodontist. Please help.

TITLE:  Bad teeth, to scared to go to dentist?
BODY: Im 18, and when growing up, parents usually tell you to brush your teeth, mine kind of expected me and i never really got in the habit, so now im trying, but i still sometimes forget (i know, gross, but serious question.) the last time ive been to a real dentist was in like 7th grade, after that i got braces and went to the orthodontist until 9th grade, which doesnt really count because all they do is tighten, remove braces and they dont check for cavities or clean them. soo i havent been to a real dentist since 7th grade. and i just graduated high school. I dont want to go because when i was little, i had bad experiences, and rude dentist and the pain was horrible. My teeth arent super white, one filling is showing and its black on the bottom, one has a small crack and is sensitive, so i know if i go they will say i have a cavity, need to fix the filling, need a root canal for the crack, and i HATE needles, dentists, and i even hate when they floss cause they floss so hard. Sometimes the pain is so bad but i wont go because im so scared, but i have no pain now, it comes and goes within the year. If there is a cavity, or the crack is bad and i dont fix it what will happen? plus i cant be put to sleep i dont have the extra money.

BODY: As a true die hard boxing fan, that's the impression that I constantly get. Most casual fans would call Floyd Mayweather's fighting style as "running" and "hugging" when they're called utilizing footwork and clinching.

I'm not even a Mayweather fan and can still acknowlege how talented Mayweather is and how smart he is in the ring. I can understand that everyone has different opinion but PLEASE, stop acting like you know a thing or two about the sport of boxing.

TITLE:  Do you think The Cavs would have won The Finals with Kevin Love?
BODY: I think The Cavs would have won the finals with K-love healthy...  People like to hate on him but the truth is he's a heck of a player who does exactly what's needed; spread the defense with his perimeter threat, rebound a lot, and give Lebron wicked outlet passes.  He's an elite shooting big man and being a Wolves fan, I've seen him make the most unlikely shots all around the court.  

Remember all the stupid 3-point shots JR Smith missed in The Finals?  Love would have drilled most of those.  People always talk about Kevin Love's lack of defense...  Do you think The Cavs just didn't know anything about that when they signed him?  Everyone on their couches is smarter than Cleveland management investing millions of dollars of cap space in a star player?  His job is to make things easier for Lebron offensively with defense secondary.

BODY: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/y7hwvK Title says it all. Will this build be capable to play most games at low settings with playable FPS. I'm mostly planning to play CS:GO at low settings and I want to know if it's a good build and will get good fps on it. Also, is it necessary to add a CPU cooler to it because I don't really plan on overclocking at all, and the case I chose comes with built in dual fans and the APU itself comes with a fan. Suggestions are helpful. As long as the build stays below $370-$350. This IS a budget build just incase you don't know.

TITLE:  Why does my hamster act like this?
BODY: I think my hamster is kinda weird. I can't tell if he likes me or not. 
Our family loves to pet the hamster and would pick him up and take him around the house. But he's never bitten anyone before. The only time he did bite was when we first got him but now he never bites. I can never tell what he is thinking though. Sometimes when I'm alone with him I would try and pick him up but he always tries to run away. Then when I put him near me some times he'd stay completely still and just stare at me until I move. Is he afraid of me or something? Once I move away he zips into a corner. He likes corners a lot.

TITLE:  Do I relax or do the keratin treatment on my bleached hair?
BODY: I've been getting relaxers done to my hair for years. Twice a year I get my new growth touched up. A few weeks back I bleached my dark brown hair to a golden blonde, I LOVE my hair color and thankfully, my hair remained strong and did not break off surprisingly. But now, my new growth is ready to be touched up by the relaxer, but I keep reading online that I shouldn't relax my now bleached hair due to the fact that I could lose my healthy blonde locks? So I researched on the keratin treatment (I know about that formaldehyde stuff) which apparently can be used on any relaxed or bleached hair type, I'm willing to pay the price for it BUT, I don't know if the keratin will damage my hair, I've read tons of horror stories of women losing their hair due to the keratin. So I'm kinda lost at what I should do.
I have poofy frizzy hair that doesn't really have any curl to it, maybe some wave, it's very similar to African American type hair if that helps.

I'm thinking of making a video with short clips to represent each verse of the poem but I don't know how to do it without being literal i.e. a verse says "stop all the clocks" and the clip shows clocks being stopped is not allowed.

So far I only have a clip for the verse "stop all the clocks" with a clip of time slowing down.

Please help!

I am curious whether the Normans that invaded Britain had remained fairly exclusive ethnically or if they had absorbed the native people of Normandy. I know the Normans 1000 years ago would look markedly different from the residents of Normandy in France today.

TITLE:  Serious wisdom teeth problem?
BODY: I have two impacted wisdom teeth on  the bottom, and there's a nerve running through both of them. A 3D x-ray revealed that the nerve runs through the roots. My oral surgeon said if he removed them, I will have permanent numbness iny chin, lips, and tounge. 

The problem is there is a hole in the gums, which can cause infection and cavities in my other teeth. Plus, they are growing completely sideways and will destroy my other teeth. 

What in the world do I do? I don't want to have messed up teeth and live in constant pain, but I don't want to lose feeling in my lips, chin and tounge either :(

TITLE:  Will ALL my hair grow back?
BODY: I began relaxing my hair years ago when I was younger because my mother had a hard time doing my hair so I kept doing it because it was easier to style but a few years ago I got a few relaxer burns and I never handled the issue because I was young and thought it was normal but now I have began dying my hair and shaving my sides, but I know my hair is extremely damaged and I want to grow back my beautiful natural long hair but I need to know if I shave ALL my hair off will it ALL grow back even with the untreated relaxer burns from years ago? Also, could I heal the burns even though I've waited years later? If so what should I use to treat it? And what should I use to keep my natural hair healthy when it began to grow back?

TITLE:  Should I go see a doctor? Or dentist?
BODY: So a while ago my jaw would lock randomly and after resting it for a couple minutes it would unlock.  But for about the past 5-6 months it has stayed locked. I can unlock it  if I push on my jaw and kind of pop it back into place but as soon as I bite down again or close my mouth it locks again. Should I go see someone about this or is there anything I can try to do to fix it?

From then on I planned to bleach the tips of my hair and to add color. After looking at my ends today they still look pretty wild.  I'm still wanting to dye the ends though- is it a no or do you think it will be alright?

My plan is to get 2 females. 
I will have the cage ready for them but if bringing in together should I keep them in cage straight away together?
and how would the towel trick work in this case? me with one guinea pig and my wife with one?

TITLE:  Hair problems?!?
BODY: i recently got my hair dyed and cut about a week ago. i had dark brown wavy hair down to the middle of my butt. i got blonde high lights and low lights (they are pretty light) and cut to about an inch above my butt. so it is still pretty long. well i know long hair is a lot to deal with in the shower. but my hair never really got knotty while washing it. three days after getting it done i washed it. my hair got so knotty i couldnt even get the shampoo and conditioner out. it was really bad. i tried combing it and i let the conditioner sit, but it just kept getting worse. it took 2 hours to get out the shower. well its been about two days since then and i just got out the shower after an hour and a half. i thought maybe since i got it curled and it had a lot of hairspray and i hadnt combed it, that that was the reason for it getting knotty the first time. but the same thing happened this time. is there something wrong?? like is my hair damaged. it has never been this bad. its in a big ball and i cant brush it. i dont know what to do?? should i call my stylist and ask or is it something else?? please help

TITLE:  Are there any rat breeders in Cleveland, OH?
BODY: Okay so I'm looking for rats to keep them as pets but I can't seem to find a decent place to purchase them that is close by. I was wondering if there are any rat breeders or shelters near the Cleveland area that I could buy them at? I would prefer a place that sells them fairly young (anywhere from 6 to 12 weeks maybe). It would also be nice if they sold a variety of rats (such as dumbo or hairless). I'm thinking of getting two males but I don't want to buy them from a pet store for obvious reasons. Thanks for any help. (:

TITLE:  My wisdom tooth is swollen and painful?
BODY: Last night after eating a chocolate bar, which I have had no problems with before, it caused pain when I chewed on the right side around the wisdom area. I have not had them out nor are they visible. After an hour or so I noticed when I closed my jaw I was closing it on the gum( so like chewing on it). Wouldn't let me fully close. I pressed my finger on the gum and it killed all around it, not the tooth next to it just the wisdom area. Swelling a little in the inner cheek too, and some pain. Any ideas what this is? Maybe an infected wisdom tooth? I'm a little worried as the swelling hasn't gone down since it happened at 1am last night and it's now 6:39-'. Thankyou!

TITLE:  Cat visitor?
BODY: So we have two male cats, and for the last few weeks a great cat has been meowling loudly outside the house. My cats just sort of watch it from a distance. About a week ago, it came into the kitchen, through the cat flap, and one of my cats is ok with it but if it gets too close he hisses. I'm pretty sure the new cat is female. He then, a few nights later, came into the dining room, even though there were three people in it (its leading from the kitchen) and I've stroked it and stuff, its pretty friendly. Last night I was woken up by some meowling in the room next door, the living room. It was lying in there with my cat watching it. Later it was jumping g around on the couch and stuff... 
Should I just let it do what it wants? We always make a point not to feed it, but maybe its owner locks it out at night (it never comes in the day). Should we try to lock it out, or leave it?
Thanks

TITLE:  Vicious TDSS Attack, Redirects and Pop Ups, won't go away?
BODY: I guess it's called a TDSS attack or something Rootkit attack. I don't know where the hell it came from, but it suddenly popped up on my computer today (I didn't do much on my computer yesterday so I don't know where it came from and it just started last night). I can't click on anything in my browser without being connected to an ad page, there's suggested link ads all over google, chrome and Firefox are slow as hell. I've used Malwarebytes, TDSSKILLER, Adwcleaner, Super Anti-Spyware, and RKill and the virus is still there. I tried using HitmanPro and it was the only program that picked up a lot of terrible viruses, but I couldn't use it cause my activation license has expired (I can't afford HitmanPro paid). I have no clue what to do. Combo fix is my last option but I have to wait to download that tonight since I have satellite internet and download speeds aren't the greatest. Can anyone help me out? Has anyone has such a virus before they couldn't get rid of? A while back I had a proxy server virus and couldn't connect to the internet, it took my two full days of no sleep to get rid of it and this so far has been much worse than that. I could really use some advice on how to get rid of this Rootkit virus or whatever it's called. Oh, I'm running Windows Vista, on a Dell Inspiron (don't know if that helps) and I use two browsers, Firefox, and Google Chrome. I also use Super Anti Spyware as my anti virus. 

Bonus Question: is Super Anti Spyware good or should I use MS Essen?

TITLE:  What type of RAM should I buy?
BODY: I currently have one 8 GB Crucial Balistix Sport CAS 9 -1600.
 I was thinking on adding an extra 8GB.
 Should I buy CAS 9 or CAS 11 stick or will it not make a difference? And should I buy 2 4GB sticks or one 8GB stick? 
This memory is really cheap right now.
http://pcpartpicker.com/part/apotop-memory-u3a4gx216c9gb

Or should I buy the same Crucial Balistix Sport stuck I have right now? 
I don't want to spend $45+.


Thanks for the help!

TITLE:  Could my head injury still be serious?
BODY: Six days ago I fell and hit my head on a rock. Now I have a bump on my forehead thats not very tall, is only a tiny bit bruised and it takes up about one third of my forehead above my right eyebrow and the area around my eye hurts a bit. The bump itself is slightly painful to the touch and I can feel a bit of pressure or something like that in the swollen area. Im not experiencing any other symptoms, but Ive read that some symptoms of a serious head injury can be delayed up to several days. Could this still be a serious injury or not? I went to the doctor but she said that I look fine and that there is no need for a CT or MRI, but I read that people can appear fine for days and even weeks after the injury even though they have a bleeding in their brain. Am I gonna be fine? Im a bit scared right now

TITLE:  How to remove a tattoo on my thigh?
BODY: I got a tattoo last Friday on the side of my upper thigh and I hate it so much I never wanted a tattoo I just got it on impulse.
I think my drink was spiked coz three of my mates went crazy one thought he was in Afghanistan another thought everyone was trying to kill him and the other passed out after being really hyper I. Was also hyper but that's not the point I suppose, it doesn't matter weather I was spiked or not I still have it

I rang the laser clinic and I can't get it removed until 6 months time have you any methods I don't care how painful its just the one that does the job by removing the tattoo and not scaring

TITLE:  Why is my kitten of my family?
BODY: I got a kitten about 3-4 weeks ago and she's really scared of my family. I'm the one that's around her the most but she has spent a decent amount of time in the same room as them and she still likes to go behind the sofa etc when they're around.

They have tried playing with her, tried to blink at her,.. but it doesn't really help and I can tell that especially my brother is starting to get annoyed with it. My mom is the one who feeds her and she's a little less scared of her although she's not comfortable around her either. When only I'm around, she loves to play, cuddle, purr,.. but simply having someone else in the same room can cause her to stop.

Why is this? Is there anything I can do about it?

Should I get a setting spray or a makeup primer?
Note that I'm going to buy one so my makeup will stay for at least 8 hours (so I only have to reapply 1-2 times a day) and I'm going to wear my makeup on very hot, humid, sunny days. I live in a country where the sun literally shines all year long with occasional rainy and windy days. 
Which one should I get to prevent my makeup from melting?

TITLE:  Spartan race shoes?
BODY: I got invited last minute to run a spartan race (sprint) in a few days and I m trying to decided whether or not I should wear my vibram five fingers or buy new shoes entirely. I d rather not have to worry about breaking in/trashing new shoes, but I don t want to hurt myself in the wrong shoes either. I ve googled opinions and they re  spilt between "they re awesome, wouldn t do a spartan in anything else!" and "dear sweet lord no you ll destroy your feet/ankles/legs in those things." 
I want something lightweight, flexible, breathable, and with a decent grip. My vibrams are pretty decent when it comes to those things, and I hike in them regularly without an issue. Have never run in them though. I should mention my ankles are prone to rolling, particularly the right, but I ll have it wrapped for the race. 
So, new shoes or will I survive in my vibrams? If you think I should go with new shoes, suggestions would be awesome. Personal experiences would be great too. Thanks!

I'd really appreciate it if someone could tell me if they could all go together or if I should have groups of 2 or 4 or so for male or female groups. also I'd like a little more information on the housing stuff like soft and hard water and acidy or not or just in general a website with good information about what they need and if anything I will just choose one because I'd like to avoid making a troubled mistake before I get the fish

TITLE:  I hit my head, am I going to be ok?
BODY: Six days ago I fell and hit my head on a rock. Now I have a bump on my forehead thats not very tall, is only a tiny bit bruised and it takes up about one third of my forehead above my right eyebrow and the area around my eye hurts a bit. The bump itself is slightly painful to the touch and I can feel a bit of pressure or something like that in the swollen area. Im not experiencing any other symptoms, but Ive read that some symptoms of a serious head injury can be delayed up to several days. Could this still be a serious injury or not? I went to the doctor but she said that I look fine and that there is no need for a CT or MRI, but I read that people can appear fine for days and even weeks after the injury even though they have a bleeding in their brain. Am I gonna be fine? Im a bit scared right now

TITLE:  The right side of my hair is thinner than the left?
BODY: I recently shaved my head, (I'm a girl) and its growing in nicely up top and on the sides.  Only problem is, though it isn't quite visible to everyone yet, is like the right "corner" at my hair line and extending inward about two inches is extremely thin. When my hair gets wet, you can see scalp clearly. My mom said its because my hair is short, and it could just be how my hair IS. My hair is still growing obviously, but does anyone know what this is or if it will correct itself eventually?

I was sleepwalking and was raped and one man hit me really hard on the back of the head- someone told me. Is this from that? How do eye floaters happen? How do i get rid of them? They are a load of them and i also get white flashes and red flashes. How can i fix this? Is this a retinal detachment and will it lead to blindness?

TITLE:  Could I have a stress fracture?
BODY: About 2 weeks ago I broke my pinky toe. I could hardly walk but obviously still had to go to work so I had to figure out a way to walk that caused as little pain as possible. Because I tell ya, that thing hurt like no one's business. Still hurts. Anyway I was able to sort of walk putting most of the pressure on the inside of my foot so that my pinky toe and majority of the outside of my foot wouldn't touch the ground. After two weeks of walking like that I was able to finally walk flat footed again. But now the bone of my big toe in my actual foot *not the toe*  hurts really bad like it's deeply bruised. And is tender to touch. But there is no bruising and is very very slightly swollen. Not even enough to notice. But it hurts like a son of a gun. I Google it and the closest I could find to it was a stress fracture. Any opinions would be appreciated. Thanks :)

TITLE:  Haircut or curly hair?
BODY: Hi. My hair is quite curly and wavy and long (when wet it reaches my tailbone). It's pretty unmanageable, frizzy, and dry looking. I haven't had it cut or trimmed in almost three years and I need a good three to four inches cut off. Any suggestions for haircuts? I'm 17, so the "soccer mom on the go" curly haircuts are a bit off putting. Extra information: My face is a rounded heart shape (my cheekbones are wide and prominent, high forehead with a widows peak, and my chin is slightly pronounced and rounded). Any suggestions are welcome, as I am willing to put time in for styling it. Tips are also appreciated, thank you!

TITLE:  I don't know what to do? (Tattoo)?
BODY: I'm not very creative or anything. My dad passed away when I was young and I wanted to get a tattoo in memory. All I was thinking about getting is a portrait from a good artist with "dad" somewhere and dates. Either on my chest or upper arm. But do portrait tattoos look tacky? I don't want just writing either. I could get things he liked, but I don't know how to incorporate them into an "in memory"  tattoo.

TITLE:  Is my Airation system in my fish tank working?
BODY: I felt like my fish were going to the surface of the water a lot to try and get air. The picture below shows my 10 gallon tank. I decided to put an old Airation system from a 2.5 gallon tank in there to see if it would help them any. The red line drawn shows where the clear tube ends. On my old 2.5 gallon tank it went close to the surface of the water. As you can see it's only going about half way threw the water in my current tank. The red circle shows where the bubbles are coming out of. I'm wondering if this is actually helping my fish or if I need to buy a longer clear tube for my Airation system. Thank you so much for your answers it will help a lot!

I have to make a playlist of what to dance to for my dances. I want my 1st dance to be Spanish, but i have no clue about Spanish songs since I don t listen to them. Can someone help and suggest songs? Also, I want a surprise dance, but in English. I was thinking of doing the YMCA or the macerana for fun and try to get the whole crowd to get up and dance with us. Is that weird or not?? Could you suggest (non hip hop) songs to dance to for my surprise dance too?

TITLE:  Uneven eyes with contacts?
BODY: So, I have a religious holiday around the corner, and I don't want to wear my glasses for my eyeshadow, so I am gonna wear contacts. But when I do, due to different vision on each eye, one eye is larger than the other when I am normally taking pictures, or talking. It looks creepy to me, and that day I will take many pictures, I want them to look good. I know this is probably unsolvable? But if you have any advice, that would be of use. Thanks!

TITLE:  Anyone having left or right eye fatigue?
BODY: I work on a computer all day, five days a week. I do wear glasses and have for most of my life. For the past couple of weeks, I have noticed that my left eye has felt tired, and I see a slight double vision when it gets tired. I made an eye appointment, and seen my eye doctor, and everything came back fine - no issues with my retina, no signs of anything wrong. However, my prescription in my left eye (the one giving me problems) did change slightly, so I got new glasses and at first it seemed to help. Now, that eye fatigue has returned. From what I have read online, it can be from lack of sleep (which I don t have), dry eyes (which I don t have), stress (maybe a little because I am in nursing school), and staring at a computer all day (which I do). Has anyone else had this issue, and if so, what were some things that worked for you? Any suggestions would be appreciated.

BODY: So I used gel in my hair in February for about a week, ever since then I've been losing hair and my scalp has been inflamed and hurt a lot! I went to the dermatologist May and he prescribed me Dermasmoothe FS Oil to ease the inflammation. I told him that part of my scalp was completely numb (and it still is), and he didn't know exactly why. He just said to use the oil for 6 months and my hair should go back to it's original thickness in 6 months. Now it's July, my hair still falls out (not as much as before, but it's still falling), the left side of my scalp is still numb and my hair is still thin. Someone please tell me what happened to my hair and scalp :( I really need some advice!

She left me with a jagged, pointy nub for a back molar and no temp crown.  I called surgeon and they can't get me into till Tuesday.  Should I be worried about my teeth shifting and should I try to get back into my dentist for temp crown until then? Also, jagged tooth is cutting up my tongue every time I try to talk.  Any suggestions on how to protect my tongue until I get back in to the dentist?

TITLE:  Is this possible?
BODY: Ever since I can remember, I've always had a problem with tartar buildup. I brush twice a day and floss about every other day. However, when I go to the dentist they always get onto me about the excess of tartar buildup. It seems no matter what, it's still here. I have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth and that's where most of it is and I brush and floss there regularly but I can't seem to get rid of it. 
My dad does have the same problem as me so I don't know if it COULD be something genetic or what. I just really want help with this because no matter what I do it seems to still be there.

TITLE:  Lower back pain from ballet?
BODY: I have been in the Arabian Corps for Nutcracker at my school for two years.
With the Arabian style, there are a lot of backbends and cambres. After the first year, the right side of my lower back hurt during class whenever I did a cambre. It's like a sharp pain. After the second year, the left side hurt. Now I have to take it easy when I bend over or cambre because both sides are in discomfort. It hurts when I do an arabesque as well.

Did I possibly damage anything? I'm very worried. Are there any positions, tips, or methods to relieve the lower back pain? Thanks!

TITLE:  Jenna Louise Coleman makeup and hair?
BODY: I've been told that I look a lot like her, so I looked her up and I think she's extremely pretty. Can anyone give me any suggestions on how to cut and style my hair like her and how she does her makeup? Thank you so much!

I have the same hair, skin, and eye colors as her as well. (I wasn't sure if that information was necessary!)

BODY: I've read so many different two sided stories, some that say brushing your hair promotes growth and is good to do everyday, and others that say studies find that brushing strips hair of proteins.

I have pretty thin, long hair thats naturally straight so I can go without brushing it but I just wanted to know whats better for hair growth and general hair care.

Also, my hair doesn't normally get  a ton of tangles.

TITLE:  Hard Drive Detection Error?
BODY: I have an MSI Z87-G41 PC Mate motherboard. I just recently got a hard drive for it as I was running solely off  240 GB SSD. I connect the hard drive, the Motherboard and BIOS detect it, but Windows 7 doesn't. I have an unregistered copy of windows on PC, and am wondering if that is the issue? I've tried multiple SATA cables on the drive and they all have the same output: Detection on Motherboard boot and BIOS, but nothing in windows. Maybe DOA drive? I can still hear it spinning when I put my ear close, so I assume it works. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you for you time

TITLE:  Can my kitten OD on Praziquantel (Doncit)?
BODY: I'm in the middle of a kitty crisis. My kitten which is 13-14 weeks old has gotten tapeworms. I didn't know about the worms until after I adopted him when I picked him up and found some on his butt around 1 am. There was a total of 4. Then he pooped maybe a dozen. I made an appointment for the vet that day. I took a poop sample and they gave my kitty the General dewormer for the night. the test came back with tapeworms, which is what I already assumed it was. They said the process is completely different for getting rid of tape worms than any other worm. Since the General dewormer I haven't seen any trace of the "tapeworms" he also had another parasite that needed an Albon treatment which he is currently still taking. The medication for the tapeworms wouldn't be in till Monday. And they said that last Thursday. It has been a whole week and I even called asking them you know, is the medicine in yet? And they said no but they will call me. Exactly 2 days ago I got tired of waiting and decided to pick up the tapeworm tablets and do the vets job for them cause I didn't have any faith they would call back. I gave him half a pill which was recommended for his weight and idk if he doesn't have tape worms anymore since I haven't seen them since 1 am last Wednesday. The vet finally calls back after I home treat him and says his prescription is in. I'm wondering would it be safe to take him in to get the injection to be sure they are gone or should I hold off? Does he need it at all?

TITLE:  Will be "bombing" my house for fleas, what do I do with my bearded dragon?
BODY: We're going to be bombing our entire house for fleas in a day or so, and I'm worried about where to keep my bearded dragon??? Also the crickets I house.
We will be required to stay out of it for 6 hours, so I need to put my bearded dragon and crickets somewhere safe. I was thinking of putting him in a tub with some stuff for him to go under/on and leaving him and my crickets outside?
I can't bring his entire cage down because it's too heavy, but I'll cover the mesh top with towels so the bomb stuff doesn't get in, and remove everything just in case it does. Then clean the tank before I put him back in.
We live in georgia, so it's pretty hot.
Will he be okay without his UVB and heat lamp if I decide to keep him at a friend's house indoors???
Please help!

TITLE:  Is my cat dead?
BODY: Hi my cat is probably 1 or 2 years old I'm not entirely sure. Her name is raz and she hates going outside. Every time she goes outside she waits by the door for us to let her in. Well I think it was either a week or 2 ago I let her out into the back yard and she sprinted off and I didn't think much about it until 2 days later I noticed I hadn't seen her. I still haven't seen her and I'm getting really worried. I'm 13 years old so I can't put up signs or look every where for her. And my family won't help me bc they didn't like her that much :( I know this sounds stupid but she's my best friend and I love her so much. I'm in tears right now writing this. Is she dead or will she come back?? Also she was never the kind of cat you can call for she was just always there :/ please help

TITLE:  How to close the gap in my teeth faster?
BODY: I've had my braces on for about a year &amp; 11 months now. The only thing now keeping me from getting them off is a small gap in between two of my top teeth. I've tried using my finger to push the teeth closer together &amp; using floss. Are there any better &amp; quicker ways?

BODY: I'm getting rubber bands on my braces because my two front teeth on my top and bottom rows don't line up. About how long will I probably need them? Please don't say it depends just give me an average of how long people have them. I know I will have to wear them 24/7 and I'm okay with that if it will work faster if I do so please don't carry on and on about that!

TITLE:  Microsoft Virus Call from Indian?
BODY: Hi, I have just received a call from an Indian person claiming to be from Mircrosoft and saying I have like a whole bunch of viruses and stuff on my Windows computer. I was suspicious about this because they told me to turn on my computer then I told them which one considering I have 6 computers and laptops in my house. They said laptop, and I said which one, I have 4 laptops, he said the Windows one, and I said which brand specifically, they all have Windows 8 and they're all different brands. He said computer again. That's when I kinda guessed it was a scam. I still turned on my computer like they told me to. However, after I turned on my computer, I felt like it was too strange for "Microsoft" to just cold call me to tell me that. I know Microsoft doesn't do that and I have read articles that this type of this is a scam. So what I'm trying to ask here is, just because I turned on my computer for them and did nothing else, does that mean that they have control over it now? Please help, I'm really scared.

Blonde to a dark brown? I'm fine if there are strands. And if I were to dye it how long should I keep it in for to make it the true color of the brown on the real human hair part? Because I know people would dye it and it'll become an ash light tone

TITLE:  Does anyone actually like brown eyes more than blue eyes?
BODY: There's a new technology out that isn't yet FDA approved but it will be - its a new procedure by stoma and its a laser that only works on brown eyes, it zaps away the melanin and leaves a blue color that is already there underneath. The procedure takes 30 minutes and it costs thousands of dollars. I was considering it because I've always been told blue eyes were prettier than brown. But now that the technology actually exists, I'm kind of on the fence about it. Would I miss my brown eyes? Maybe. So does anyone out there actually prefer brown eyes over blue?

she has been an eplisopy cat since dec 2011. I notice her seizures are getting shorter from the length of time they are now 1 month 1/2 apart use to be 3-4 months. 

She doesn't qualify for meds yet, but I just wish i knew what is the cause but her seizures do last 20-30 secs after that she will be sorta out of it looking around and i calm her down.

TITLE:  Haircuts and styles for curly hair?
BODY: Hi. My hair is quite curly and wavy and long (when wet it reaches my tailbone). It's pretty unmanageable, frizzy, and dry looking. I haven't had it cut or trimmed in almost three years and I need a good three to four inches cut off. Any suggestions for haircuts? I'm 17, so the "soccer mom on the go" curly haircuts are a bit off putting. Extra information: My face is a rounded heart shape (my cheekbones are wide and prominent, high forehead with a widows peak, and my chin is slightly pronounced and rounded). Any suggestions are welcome, as I am willing to put time in for styling it. Tips are also appreciated, thank you!

TITLE:  How do you get your computer to stop downloading things by itself?
BODY: I downloaded this game on my computer it's remember.exe and it's been doing weird things to my computer. It won't let me open it and my computer says that it has a virus and is dangerous. I've clicked on remove because I don't want my computer to get messed up but when I do it says 'item not found, try again.' or something like that. And things keep popping up and things got downloaded like anti-virus, even a freaking weather app and this google chrome thing that has no color on the design. How can I get it to stop? I really don't want my computer to crash, that happened to my last one and the people couldn't find out what was wrong with it so they gave me a replacement. This is my replacement. So what do I do? Thank you!

As soon as I removed the eyelash curler from my eye I realized that half the length of my eyelashes had been cut off!!! My eyelashes were freshly washed without mascara or any other product. My eyelashes are already pretty short to begin with. Now it looks like I have practically no eyelashes on one eye. When I apply mascara it helps a little bit, but I m freaking out and I need A natural way to make my eyelashes longer. Please Help ME!!!!!!!!!😫

TITLE:  Mac infected with porn virus?
BODY: So I was about to stream game of thrones when I end up getting what seems to be a legit message from Apple themselves telling me that the computer has been infected with a porn virus and they have blocked the browser to reduce security risks a bit. When the message popped up the appke website opened up a new tab.  They strongly inform that they call Apple as its a serious hack. I tried to dismiss the message but it refused. Couldn't close Chrome. I just force shut down the computer.
Is the legit? How did I get a porn virus when I never went on porn sites on this computer??
And if real what I should do to remove it?

I'm scared for athletics because I'm more of a strong athlete than I am of a fast one. I'm really slow and I've been spending my whole summer worrying about it and trying to get faster. 

I'm afraid to humiliate myself and have everyone talk about me and saying how slow I am.

I feel really unmotivated.

BODY: I had two of my wisdom teeth removed (on my left side) about 24 hours ago. I haven't eaten for the last 36 hours and, although I'm not feeling hungry at all, I still feel a little dizzy and I can tell my body needs food. However, I am absolutely terrified of eating because I worry about swallowing too hard and causing myself dry socket. I'm also worried about getting any food near the wound. Should I take any precaution while swallowing food?

TITLE:  What can I do with my hair?
BODY: My natural hair is dark brown with a very subtle golden undertone. Last year I had a cherry red bob and but started to grow y hair out and bleached the red part. So now I have long hair with a orangey red ombre. I did with with a brush so it looks more natural with the darker part.

I get easily bored with my hair. What shall I do next? I don't want to cut it, I'm talking about coloring. My hair is naturally very straight and fine.

BODY: Among the ancients we do not find much science in Egypt, China and India, and just a bit of it in Greece and it was absent in Rome. The Arabs had the scientific spirit of enquiry and they may be considered to be the father of the Modern Science.
The main achievement of medieval Arabic Medicine and its influence on the European Medicine was in the field of:-
Systemization.
Development of Pharmacology.
Establishment of Surgery.
Establishment of Ophthalmology.
And
Building of Hospitals.

BODY: Would my hairdresser be able to get my hair the colour I want? 

 I want to go a very light ash/icy blonde I have dyed light yellow blonde hair atm 

 She told me that she will be doing bleach highlights to lighten it up as my hair would not withstand a full head bleach in one go and if she tried it would break that's why she suggested bleach highlights and told me it would be a gradual process. 

 Anyway I am the girl on the left and I want my hair the same colour as the pic on the right, would that colour suit me and would she be able to get it that light? 

 My natural colour is dark blonde/light brown 

she said she will formulate a new colour for me, 

 heres a pic of the shade of blonde I want I am the girl on the left and I want my hair the silvery blonde colour (right) Is the colour I want much lighter than what I currently have?

TITLE:  Is there an official messenger app for Facebook what runs in a Windows PC?
BODY: It's inconvenient to have firefox open all the time.
I need a stand-alone facebook app that runs in the desktop (NOT metro version, i hate everything metro).
I'm using Windows 8.1 x64.
I have so far tried with Pidgin and Skype.
Pidgin doesn't work- it says connecting.... forever. It works with my Yahoo messenger account and Google talk account, but the moment I add a facebook account, it says "connecting..." and nothing happens, no errors, but keeps saying connecting and won't show FB contacts in buddy list,



Skype sort of works, but when a facebook contact comes online or goes offline, it plays the chime on the speakers but won't show the notification near the system tray that the contact came online- i just keep hearing these sounds, contacts coming online and offline, but have no clue who came online or went offline- only way to check is to go thru the entire list of 300+ friends.
Skype used to work fine, but it installed an update yesterday and since then this weird behavior started.


Is there an official messenger?
Thanks.

TITLE:  PLZ ANSWER! How do i tell my parents i want to see the eyedoctor?
BODY: I have been trouble seeing far away. My eyes keep straining and I've been having headaches because of my eyes. Everything is blurry from a distance.  Last time i went to the eye doctor, they said i have a .4 prescription but they didn't give me glasses.  They have gotten worse. Ive been hinting to my parents that my eyes hurt, things are blurry from a distance, And they say its other things.  My mom says that I've been using my phone to much which is not true.  We hadn't had internet for 3 weeks and i was bored to death.  My mom also thinks whenever we are at the eye doctor, i fake it.  When i was little i wanted glasses so she probably gets it from that.  My dad says i have sinuses and he puts an onion in my room.  Bleh.  I try to tell them, but i know they will say i wont need it.  Im also scared that if we do go, i might be perfectly fine and they win. What do i do? Thx for answering and sorry this is long lol.

But, what i've been most concerned about is a numb site just to the left of the cut. I have all sensation on my cut, which is a few inches below, but to the lower left i have lost all feeling, and its also warm. It never bruised, and i can still walk so?

TITLE:  Can I improve my 12 minute run by 1 mile in 3 days?
BODY: I am very active and have played all kinds of sports throughout most of my life. I'm a pretty decent athlete overall but I really just can't seem to get the hang of running. My endurance has always been pretty pathetic. Even in school, I was usually the one who struggled the most during any running exercises during practice... Now that I'm 21 and in college, this doesn't seemed to have improved much. I'm not the worst runner in my pe classes, but I'm probably barely average. So yes, for someone like me, who had to work super hard, feeling like my lungs were on fire, just to run only A LITTLE over a mile in 12 minutes... 

People keep telling me to keep trying but I'm really starting to lose confidence.. I have a final exam in my pe class next week which is basically just doing the 12 minute run again. My semester goal was t o be able to run up to 2 miles or at least close to that in 12 minutes but I feel like I haven't made enough of an improvement. I only have 3 days left to prepare. Is there anything I can do to improve my endurance before the exam? Will jump roping help if I can't always go running?

After 4 days, his eyes look clear and coughing stopped but he is still sneezing and now blood is coming out. On top of that he has a small cut on his upper lip directly below the nose (almost midline)..could it be more than URI?

BODY: I asked a question earlier how to remove a vicious Rootkit attack my computer is experiences and I will be following the advice (for those who answered that question) but I was wondering, right now my computer had been scanning all my files and drives with Malwarebytes. It's been going for 4 hours now and nothing has been detected. I figured so because I've scanned it three times and each time the threat detected got lower and lower. I figured his was the final time I had to do it (the last scan said 5 out of 7 threats were quarantined). However I happened to catch that Malwarebytes was scanning this folder called "Catroot" and I looked it up and it's apart of this Rootkit virus but malwarebytes still says there are no threats detected. Why is this? Is it because this virus is so bad and difficult to remove?

She is a 25 yr old Arab with no jumping training before this… ideas? My instructor said she would teach me to jump but I want to work on it with this horse too… and I can't trailer her out.

TITLE:  What's the best health plan if your enrolled in newjersey family care ?
BODY: Hi what is the best health plan out of the ones they have which is good for some one who is eligible and enrolled in newjersey family care 

The health care programs are : 

-United health care community 
- amerigroup newjersey 
- horizon nj health 
- Aetna better health nj 
- well care health plans 

I am basically for a simple health plan for my general health overall and basically want to focus more on a plan which has good benefits for someone who has braces on as I am moving from UK to newjersey and I already have braces on for the last 23 months now and my orthodontist just gave me elastic bands for me to insert In my mouth on hooks 24/7 so assuming that it is at the end of the process what do you guys think? 

Anyone with any valuable information or similar experience will be much appreciated 

Kind Regards

I fell awkwardly on it again which caused the bruise to flare up and start hurting again. What is the quickest way to heal a bruise like this? To be precise its on my gluteas medius. What would be the healing time? I am also not sure if it is the actual muscle bruised or the bone. There is no appearance of a bruise

TITLE:  What should I do about this kitten?
BODY: For a couple of weeks now, a kitten has been found on my porch, by my door, under porch chairs around my apartment just always around here. She's very kind. She let me pet her after a few days. She rubs herself on my legs and she comes to me when I squat down. Whenever I give her clean water or cold milk, she will walk to it, but will never drink it. She's always napping around here, also. Today, I opened my door and she walked right inside my apartment. And she looked around and tried to crawl under my bed but I pulled her out but she kept meowing as if saying please. I would love to keep her. But I'm not sure if she belongs to someone. She doesn't look hungry. She looks healthy. But I barely know anything about cats. I finally got her out of the house and she looked at me and walked away. I went back inside to get flip flops and when I came back out she was gone. I don't know if she's hungry or lost or just homeless. Help?

About 2 years ago I ran the 100 in 12.9 seconds and the 200 in 26.7 seconds. I think my time now in the 100m could be around 11.9 - 12.3 seconds and my 200m time maybe around 25 seconds. So do I have a shot at making state?

BODY: I currently have shoulder length hair. It is medium thickness and mostly straight with a slight wave. I can't pull it up or back or anything without getting a migraine, so I'm thinking of getting a pixie cut. The only problem is that every styling product I have used makes my scalp itch like crazy, so my question is is it possible to make a pixie cut look decent without styling products? And also, this is the first haircut that I'm paying for myself and I don't know how much to tip a hairdresser.

BODY: A couple months ago I decided I wanted bangs. I researched different styles and found one I loved. So we went to a family friend who is a hair stylists and she cut my hair. When she finished I was so excited! But then I saw them. They were short, ugly and I hated them. They aren't straight across bangs. They look like this but shorter. Anyways I can't put them into a ponytail and if I don't pin them up they get really greasy from sweat because it's summer where I live. Any hairstyles you can give me? With tutorials preferably. Thanks!!

TITLE:  Should I re-activate a Facebook account?
BODY: Years ago when Facebook was new I had an account. It did not work for me as I am socially inept. Or something like it. My "friends" list was empty, and anyone in which I did friend but never spoke with was removed. Simply put, I was there for friends, not numbers.

In the end, It did not work out for me. So, I eventually deleted it. Along with its accompanying e-mail, since it was created only for said account. This was years ago. 

So the real question is, "Should I activate a Facebook account?"

I am not a fan of any social media. Mostly because of stupid reasons. Yet it is still a point in my mind. However, I am a 24, going on 25 year old Male, who is lonely. I have literally, and I use that word with its dictionary explanation, no friends. Nor have I had any since Primary school (Kindergarten to 5th grade). I doubt anyone cares for my life story. I am just trying to make a point.
 
Currently unemployed, and not in school. In a neighborhood in which I consider "dead" seeing how there is no activities to do. I have no idea how to meet new people. I am not interested in "dating" per-say. But if it happens it happens. Making most of those websites useless to me. I just want people to chat with in my area. To help me break out of this depression and shell I have engulfed myself in.

With all that said. Would Facebook be a necessary evil for me? Would it help, or would everything just remain the same, just with another account out there?Or is there a better way?

TITLE:  Don't like the Fabtron Lady Trail I bought?
BODY: I bought a fabtron lady trail saddle off Craigslist a while ago. I finally tested it out yesterday and I really don't like it at all! I've never sat in something so hard. It feels like sitting on cement and it pushes my top half forward I feel. I read so many reviews that said it was the "most comfortable saddle ever" etc. but I beg to differ. 

Do any of you have one? Do you like it? I think I'm going to sell it then add money to buy a better saddle.

BODY: Tyger Tyger, burning bright, 
In the forests of the night; 
What immortal hand or eye, 
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies. 
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand, dare seize the fire?

And what shoulder, &amp; what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? &amp; what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain, 
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp, 
Dare its deadly terrors clasp! 

When the stars threw down their spears 
And water d heaven with their tears: 
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Tyger Tyger burning bright, 
In the forests of the night: 
What immortal hand or eye,
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

TITLE:  Any snake experts? Saw one in front of my apartment...?
BODY: I live in northeast FL and I came home about an hour ago and saw what I thougt was a turtle peek its head out of a drainage pipe in front of my apartment. I got closer to investigate and discovered that it was actually a snake. I have small kids and a toy breed dog so I took a can of bengal roach spray which freezes on contact and I sprayed it for about 15 seconds trying to drive it away but it wouldn t budge so I boiled a pot of water and threw it in the pipe and the snake disappeared. About a half hr later I went back out to see if it returned and while it was still gone I saw a baby snake about 6 inches long slithering around with bright yellow stripes that ran parallel down its body. I couldn t see the adult snake s body but it s head looked just like a turtle s. What kind of snake do you think it might be? Was it giving birth to baby snakes possibly or was the baby snake a coincidence?  I have lived here a year and have NEVER seen a snake anywhere on the property then 2 within an hour of each other. My dog poops in that area, was it here to eat her? Thanks

I can't also open cebupacificair.com which is a website of some local airline company.

Chrome always says it's "connecting" then after that it will just show this message: 

This webpage is not available

ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT

Anyway, I can open my Twitter, Google and some other sites.

How do you resolve this?

TITLE:  Rate my writing (be honest, but please don't be rude)?
BODY: It's basically a poem, but it doesn't rhyme.

I am fire. 

My crimson flames lick the top of the brick fireplace. I crackle and pop with hypnotizing rhythym, drawing you in; closer to the hot wave of air. I cast a warm, amber glow across your face and the flames sparkle in your eyes. You feel the heat spreading across and melting into your skin. As you watch, captivated, the scarlet sparks float up like a hundred fire flies before fading away. Flakes of ash follow the sparks and float into the air, before descending, falling silently like snow. Like magic, an intricate dance is displayed before you as the fire leaps and kicks. You can't look away. You scoot closer to the inviting warmth, a hot chill prickling up your arms. The yellow flames at the base of the fire slowly change to sapphire blue, the fire growing hotter. You could watch the dance of the flames and listen to the harmony of the crackle and pop forever.

TITLE:  A week after head injury?
BODY: Six days ago I fell and hit my head on a rock. Now I have a bump on my forehead thats not very tall, is only a tiny bit bruised and it takes up about one third of my forehead above my right eyebrow and the area around my eye hurts a bit. The bump itself is slightly painful to the touch and I can feel a bit of pressure or something like that in the swollen area. Im not experiencing any other symptoms, but Ive read that some symptoms of a serious head injury can be delayed up to several days. Could this still be a serious injury or not? I went to the doctor for a check up and she said that I look fine and that there is no need for a CT or MRI, but I read that people can appear fine for days and even weeks after the injury even though they have a bleeding in their brain. Am I gonna be fine? Im a bit scared right now

TITLE:  Are there porta potties in distance running races?
BODY: Hi everyone!  I'm running my first 10k in October, and I am extremely nervous because I suffer from SEVERE irritable bowel syndrome.  I am wondering if there are typically porta potties along distance running race courses?  I have read a million articles about the issue of finding a porta potty BEFORE the race because the lines are long, but I am specifically wondering if there are porta potties available DURING the race.  I am going to start experimenting with taking Imodium Plus before running, because I think that will be my best option, but with a case as bad as mine, I'm not sure that will be enough... (sorry for the graphic images you probably all just got!)

TITLE:  Hair extensions question?
BODY: Ive been looking around everywhere and havent really found much so an answer from someone with hair extension knowledge would be great.

Maybe about 5 months ago I shaved all my hair off and ive grown it out to about an inch and a half but i really just want shaved sides and about 5-6 inches of bangs and my hair is very slow at growing which is frustrating because The style i want literally required just 4 more inches of hair and suits me very well as ive had it before so its annoying to have such low confidence.

Is it possible to get (and i do not mean clip in but if clip in would work thats cool) to get some extensions in the bang area to lengthen hair? Ive seen people with pixie cuts make their hair very long from extensions but I just want it to be a pixie cut (hah)

Any help would be appreciated.

TITLE:  Questions regarding leopard geckos?
BODY: I've been seriously considering purchasing a leopard gecko. I've done a bit of research but some information seems contradictory. I get that leopard geckos are supposed to be dessert dwelling reptiles and that heat needs to be maintained. Some information says that you may or may not need to use an under-tank heater(?) while other information says that you need various lamps. Can I purchase a new unused fish tank and use it for reptiles? To me it seems to be cheaper purchasing a fish tank and adding items necessary for a reptile than purchasing one of the reptile terrarium kits. I don't see the difference between a fish tank and the tank included in a reptile kit if there even is a difference. Also, it is to my understanding that a 10 gallon tank would be sufficient for one gecko. Is that true? When it comes to feeding, can I give a leopard gecko dried crickets, mealworms, etc if I have to or do they specifically have to be live during every feeding? I'm not sure how often I'd be able to purchase live insects from the pet store as I don't have one local to me.

I've never dealt with leopard geckos or any reptile for that matter so if anyone has any tips or anything important to add that would be great.

TITLE:  What is the best drugstore hair styling product that is strong and matte?
BODY: Hi, I currently use L'Oreal Advanced Hairstyle TXT IT 02 Hyper-Fix Putty to style my hair, but lately I've been dissatisfied with it, so I was wondering if there were any other products I could get at like CVS? I need a cream/putty/paste kind of product that is matte and has strong hold. Also, my hair can't naturally be in an upward style (it can only be down and flat, which is depressing), so I need a product that is strong enough to bring it up and keep it up. If I wash my hair, it usually becomes a little hard for me to put my hair up even with products, so I need a product that can do that.

All those times I wanted to do only roots but the reason I have been coloring my whole hair is because I can't get the exact color that I want. Now my hair is dry and also my midlenghts and ends are turning light brown.. I want to be golden blonde, so I bought a high lift blonde 12 color but I am hesitating because what if it turns even darker since my hair has been over processed? Is it really bad to keep dyeing my whole hair like that?

TITLE:  Hair masks?
BODY: So I want to do a hair mask but every one I have looked at I don't have all the ingredients so I was wondering if I could just use ingredients from other ones and just mix them together. And would that work or just hurt my hair.

Could he have ran way to die? Our beloved dog Dave tried to do that, so could it be possible with the cat too?

TITLE:  I am considering transforming my blog into a niche blog but unsure how to go about it?
BODY: I currently write a blog called Writing Gravity on Wordpress and I own the domain. When I started Writing Gravity, I decided not to go with any particular niche because I like to write about many different things. 

I have written about celebrity controversies, my spirituality, technology, and several other topics, but I am a poet and trying to write anything but poetry is starting to get difficult. 

Today, I posted two of my original poems to my blog, which is something I have never done before. I am considering moving into poetry blogging; my own original poems and analysis/reviews of other poets' work. 

In the interest of not buying a second domain, as I do not have the money for that, I would like to shift the focus of the one I already have. Any recommendations or advice for how I should do this?

TITLE:  Can you do a texturizer treatment on 2b/c hair?
BODY: My hair is wavy/curly and no matter what I do it dries frizzy. I was reading that texturizers loosen the curl pattern and smooth the hair. However, I have only found reviews online from people with really curly hair. Does anyone know how it works for people with more of a wavy hair texture? I am looking for something that will smooth my hair out without completely straightening my hair.

Thanks!

TITLE:  Sun damage to my eye?
BODY: So i was riding in my friends car, and the sun was about to set (still in the sky, kind of a orange color) and i looked over at it through the window (i also had sun glasses on). I store at it for about 3-4 seconds, and then looked away. There was a blue/green spot on my eye for about two minutes, and then it went away. I don't see any spots on my eye anymore but my right eye kind of hurts a little bit (which was the eye that was closest to the window, also i'm writing this probably about an hour and a half after it happened). Are my eyes ok? Am i over reacting? Thank you, i really appreciate it.

Should I go with:
"Can I get a tattoo?"
"I've been thinking about tattoos and I want one."
"When can I get a tattoo?"
"Would you let me get a tattoo?"
or something else??

I may also add that I still want to keep the dark brown I just want to have more color to it.

I've been practicing R.I.C.E all morning, when I try to get up to go to the bathroom I can't. I have to crawl because every time I put pressure on either ankle I get an excruciating pain. They're not broken though because I can wiggle my toes and move my feet in circles (kinda) I can't use crutches because it would require me standing on one of my ankles. Should I get a wheelchair?

BODY: So, me and my 24 year old sister (i'm 13) got into a big argument today about shoes. (I know, stupid) but that's not the point. After the fight, she tried to scare me by telling me that she has a lot of friends who are great with computers (which she does) and that she will get one of them to find out my password for Instagram. I have the same password for everything, so if she finds out my Instagram password, she can hack into all of my stuff. Is this possible? Can she really do this? I'm kind of scared. She does have multiple friends who are great with computers and I feel like they could hack things. And who knows what she will do if she does......she's really mad at me right now.

TITLE:  My cat has bald spots! Why?
BODY: I have a male cat named Louie. He is about 2 years old. About a week ago I noticed he has a bald spot on his back leg that is as large as a nickel. Within a few days I noticed two more bald spots: one on his stomach and one on his front leg. When I have taken a closer look at them I don t see any soars, redness, rashes, or bite marks. About a month ago I took Louie to the vet and he was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection. He was given antibiotics and seemed to make a great recovery and is back to acting like his normal self. Is it possible that he is having an allergic reaction to it? Even though its a month later? If not what could it be? I am very worried and don t know what to do. Any advice would be very helpful!

TITLE:  How to guard people who push off and stop taller guards?
BODY: I'm a solid defender and unlike many I actually like playing defense. I keep up with everyone but when people try to get by me they grab my leg or shoulder. I don't really know how to defend that because you can't hand heck or anything without a foul being called. But on most people I can recover before they get to the basket. At that time the offensive player usually stiff-arm's me (literally)  or  uses his elbow to push me. I am relatively strong now so I don't know what to do. Plus I'm only 5'7 so if they are taller than me it makes it difficult cause I can't block their shot without a foul being called.

TITLE:  I Think my cat is getting jealous?
BODY: Iv had my cat since she was born, a year ago and shes always been a very loving playful sweety. But just 2 weeks ago i bought a ferret. They play together fine and even the dog joins in, however iv noticed that since i got her my cat has become more clingy? She follows at my heals meowing and will sit at my feet or even jump into my lap and meow until i give her attention. This is very abnormal for her to do. She sleeps with me and whenever she wants attention she will usually just sit beside me or at my feet, she has never sat in my lap before without me holding her there and now i cant seem to do anything without her yelling at me and following me around?
Is this normal? Or is there something wrong. I have not been less affectionate toward her i love her very much still.

BODY: My cat is like digging himself raw! He has scabs all over himself from where he has been scratching. I've checked him for flees and he doesn't have any (he is mostly white so flees would be easy to spot) we also have other animals who would also be scratching if he had flees. I decided to come on here and ask if anyone would know what could help him before I took him to the vet.

TITLE:  Where doses this virus keep coming from?
BODY: So I went on this certain website on my home's computer ("Dad's", apparently it's neither "ours" nor does mom apparently have a share in it the way he acts...). I won't say what website because I don't want anyone going there (no, it was not porn or anything like that). The first time I went there, or really the first few times, dad noticed a computer virus and said it was from that site. He said it was either because the website was Russian or that it's just a Russian website, I can't remember. The strange thing was I could get on the website from school just fine with nothing ever happening. The next time I was on (a few months later, I think because I doubted that the virus was real or something) I got on the same computer, and this time it wrecked the computer so bad it had to be rebooted and all our files were lost.The weird thing is I've been on the same website on my cell phone, the library computers, and even my grandparent's computers, and nothing ever happened. Then, just two days ago I decided to get on the website from our home Xbox One. Then the next morning I got my dad calling me again about being on the website. He said he fixed the problem up fine. He said he would cancel my account on the Xbox (I also at that time was up until 5:30 a.m. surfing the internet, but that's beside the point.) I don't know if he did or not because I haven't been on it since then.

BODY: They don't really swim around a lot. I just see them stationary in certain places eating. Is this normal? I recently purchased 12 cherry shrimp from the local pet store and keep them in a filtered 3.5 gallon tank. There is a lot of java moss for them to feed on. I recently did a 40% water change with reverse osmosis water. The ph is at about 7.8 and the temp is around 76-78 degrees. I got the shrimp about 4 days ago, and I noticed that they are not swimming around at all. I see them eating the java moss, but they don't really swim in front of me. Why is this?

TITLE:  Will I be bald soon in the future?
BODY: So I was on bodybuilding.com and there's this kid supposedly that had hair on his pecks at 13. When I was 14 my full torso was full of hair. I have very hairy legs, upper legs, butt, armpits, but not back. I also have a full head of hair. Does early hair growth mean that those glands or whatever will stop working in like my 30s ish or something? That's what it said on there. Also if this helps my dad in highschool had a full head of hair. He's been bald for a while now. He's 40. I have no idea about any of this. Lol

TITLE:  How to physically excercise a leg that was broken.?
BODY: So, my 11 year old little brother was in an accident where a car ran over his foot while he was on the sidewalk, the bone just above his ankle broke, if he s was older he would have gone through surgery and later his leg was going to be put in a cast, but because he was very young surgery would be too risky so they put his leg directly into a cast, about 2 months later they removed his cast and said that he should start trying to walk to week later (they also told that he should excercise his leg vertically to regain his muscle mass in the week the cast was removed, which he didn t do much) so a week has passed and he says that when he trys to step on it hurts and starts crying because of the pressure, I wanted to ask how he should do the excercise, and should we hold his foot and move it by hand, thanks in advance.

BODY: I found a white fluffy kitten running around an empty parking lot about a week ago. He's extremely malnourished &amp; he had a few ticks on him. It took me a while to take the ticks out. I heard bathing a kitten is bad so I had to use a comb. Right now I'm feeding him wet food. Should I be feeding him formula?
I don't want to give him to the humane society because I know they will put him down for his weak state.

BODY: Earlier today (6 hours ago) I jammed my right pointer finger pretty bad and I have jammed many fingers and have broken fingers so I can distinguish kind of what happened and how serious the injury actually is but it seems like this time I might have jammed it worse than I thought. I'm laying down not moving it and it's throbbing and in pain and I've never had that happen for a jammed finger before only when I move it but now it's doing it and my whole knuckle is swollen and I can barely move it. Is it possible that I may have also fractured a bone in it?

The three that i can buy are:
Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security 2013 OEM 3 User - $13 AUD
Kaspersky OEM 1 User 1 Year Internet Security 2013 - $15 AUD
Symantec Norton Internet Security 2013 OEM - 1 User - $16 AUD
or should i just get all three for good measure?

MSY only stocks those three, but if they aren't any good i'd be willing to download one

TITLE:  Extreme tibia pain while running?
BODY: Hi there! I've been getting into running during the summer. I find it strangely enjoyable. I like feeling really tired at the end. It's a pleasurable feeling.
Anyway, I want to keep going longer and longer distances to push myself. I started out doing a little over a mile everyday. Then, I pushed it to 1.5 miles a day. Then I did that twice a day. And now, I run 2 miles, twice a day. It takes about 12 minutes each time.
The problem is that my feet hurt like hell. I looked it up, and it's pain in my tibia. It's not exactly in my foot, but just above it, on the inner side. As I run more and more, the pain goes higher and higher. It's extremely painful. 
At first, I just told myself, "Enjoy the pain and push through it!" But it's getting really, really bad. I now I can probably run for longer, but sometimes the pain in my tibia just gets overwhelming and I can't make it through more than a minute. 
I'm a flatfoot. I got insoles, but it's more painful with them on than with them off.
Is there something I can do to help the pain?

TITLE:  How much biotin should I take to help facial hair grow?
BODY: I'm currently taking two 5,000 mcg's of Spring Valley a day and haven't seen any changes to my facial hair yet. I noticed that on the side of my head, my hair and sideburns are getting a little thicker because I have a mohawk. I'm 17, 5'9 and 120 pounds . Should I take more mcg's than that or keep it the same amount (10,000 mcg's) ? Help please

TITLE:  How to relieve gum pain caused by temporary crown?
BODY: So I had my front tooth root canaled (3rd time cause it keeps getting infected), a metal post put in and a temp crown placed on the tooth. The dentist said my gums around the area would be swollen for 3-4 days and painful. I did not expect it to be this painful. Anything I can do to relieve the pain? I m not allowed to brush or floss that area for up to a week. Despite eating only soft foods I still got food stuck in that area and I can t floss it out. So now my gums are bleeding a bit. Sorry to be so detailed but I won t be seeing my dentist for another 3 weeks and really would like to do something to ease the pain.

BODY: I practice and play open gym games everyday of the week and sometimes I miss weekends but never week days. I normally spend aTleast 3 hours in the gym also. I'm not a very good passer, and an ok ball handler but I'm known for shooting. I can shoot anywhere on the court and sense I'm taller for my age I never get blocked. I'm a starter for my highschool and I play a 4(power foward) and 3(foward). I just want to know if I even qualify to be in a college for basketball. Also my GPA for my freshman year was 3.0 if I keep up that GPA will it make it easier for me to get recruited?

The initial blow did hurt, and I did have a headache for a little while after, but it went away and I am showing no signs of a concussion. I was wondering if I should sleep because I know you're not supposed to sleep after getting a concussion...I'm also worried that I could be bleeding in my brain because I don't want to die from this...should I stay up all night? What about my brain bleeding? Should I go to the ER in the morning?

TITLE:  Dental Malpractice - Is there a way to get my money back? What can I do?
BODY: I went to an orthodontist for Invisalign treatment, which was estimated to be about a year and a half, but after two years, my teeth weren't moving properly. It was at this point that he did a full palate x-ray and noticed that my canine was impacted. He did take x-rays prior to beginning treatment, but apparently not full ones. In those two years, I already paid $5000 for the entire Invisalign treatment-out of pocket. He then tells me that Invisalign won't work and I need braces. He handed me off to another orthodontist, who is currently working on my case as a favor to him, and I have not heard from him since. It's three years since I began initial treatment and my teeth are still messed up.

Is there anything I can do about this?

TITLE:  Do I Have to Gradually Overclock?
BODY: I'm a beginner in overclocking (AKA never overclocked before, ever) and I'm planning on overclocking my 4690k once I get my Cryorig h7. I've been reading quite a lot about it and I'm a bit confused. In this article http://www.anandtech.com/show/8227/devils-canyon-review... it says to set your CPU to 40x multiplier and 1.000v and gradually increase it, adding 0.025v when theres instabilities and if theres none add another 1x multiplier. If they have already found how far the 4690k can be pushed, can't I just whack in 47x multiplier and 1.300v in the bios and savemyself a lot of time?

I'm really not sure if that's what most people do anyway or if there's some sort of problem with that?

Anyway, help would be appreciated. Thanks :) 

PS - Do you think a 650W PSU would be ok for an overclocked 4690k CPU and a 980Ti (EVGA Superclocked+ ACX+)

BODY: Hello, recently I've been looking into actually doing some serious gaming on PC. However, my 'build' was thrown together using a few parts I had laying around, plus a *very* low end graphics card, currently consisting of:

PSU: EVGA 430w 80+ PSU
CPU: AMD Sempron X2 190 (2.5GHz, AM3)
RAM: Kingston 2x4GB DDR3 (1333MHz, Non-ECC/Unbuffered, 240-pin DIMM)
HDD: Seagate Pipeline HD2 (500GB 3.5")
Motherboard: ASRock 960GM-VGS3 (AM3+, SATA II, Micro ATX)
GPU: Gigabyte GV-N640OC-2GI (NVIDIA GeForce GT 640, Rev 2, 2GB GDDR5)
Optical Drive: Samsung SH-224DB (24x, DVD-RW)

As you can probably tell, it's not the best, but it's not totally incapable for a one-hour build.
Here are the upgrades I plan to buy, but I don't know if I should go all-out and buy these. Would I be okay by compromising and using a few of the parts I already have?

P.S: I am planning to keep the hard drive I have, and use it in conjunction with an SSD.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Alex

TITLE:  Why doesn't my leopard gecko want to be held any more?
BODY: I've had my leopard gecko for 2.5 months now.  I adopted him from a reptile rescue and he had been owned by a previous owner for two years so he was very tame when I  got him.  I left him alone for a week so he could get adjusted and after that I got attached very quickly.  He was easy to hold and he wanted to come out every night.  The first few times I would kind of scoop him into my hands but then I decided to start letting him choose so I would hold out my hand for him to climb on instead of picking him up.  He usually would and there were no problems.  Note, i haven't held him every day for more than a month there have been days in between.  But lately he hasn't wanted to be held at all or even shown the slightest interest in wanting to come out of  his cage in 2-3 weeks even though I still offer my hand once in awhile.  I've been very patient and will continue to be, but I'm worried.  Does he not like me anymore or is it just one of those things I have to wait out?  I'm just wondering if he doesn't like me anymore because when I put my hand in there he used to acknowledge me by nudging it with his snout and licking it.  Now he doesn't even nudge, in fact, he shies away.  Did I do something wrong? Or is anything wrong?

TITLE:  I keep falling on the same knee?
BODY: About two weeks ago I fell down three steps and my left knee broke my fall. Mind you I have bad knees as it is doctors can't diagnose my problem one doctor shrugged it off and said it was growing pains and gave me a brace for both knees... I have constant pain and I can't run without throbbing pain. Needless to say I just fell down the stairs again. So within 2 weeks I fell down the stairs twice and the same knee has broken my fall each time. It's already black and blue from the first fall. It's worse. I can't bend it all the way from the first fall without pain. I felt very off balanced I've felt like that a lot lately. But anyway I'm worried and my dad wants to go straight to the er tomorrow. What are they gonna do I'm nervous. Can it be sprained, torn or just bruised!? Help!

BODY: So theres a girl on facebook i been messaging for a while. 

Its been three weeks now since i sent her my last text. 
She was online like only three time during that time.

The text still did not change to delivered, only sent.

So if she set herself invisible to me ONLY, the text would still change to delivered right?

But since she WAS online a couple of times, the text should change to delivered anyways, so whats the case here?

Did she somehow not get the message, or is had she set herself invisible to me only?


Thanks for answers

My cat likes to go outside and it's almost impossible to keep him as an indoor cat since he goes crazy if he doesn't go out. Anyways I'm worried someone will use rat poison and my cat will get poisoned. He doesn't eat the rats, he just plays rough with them until they die. Why should I do?!

I don't like her in my bedroom as I have carpet and she flicks her bedding everywhere which sticks to the carpet.. Whereas the living room has hard flooring where I can clean it up easily. She also makes a lot of noise on a night and I struggle to sleep with her. The thing is sometimes she's just asleep and doesn't bother with us making noise, and other times she actually comes out to see everyone and is happy to be brought out in front of everyone. Am I doing her any harm?

TITLE:  What can I do about my baby bearded dragon while I go on a 3 day vacation?
BODY: I'm leaving for a 3 day vacation to go out of state next week, and recently I got a baby bearded dragon about a month ago. My mom and I are the ONLY 2 people in the family that don't mind reptiles and know how to care for him. Because my parents are divorced, she has to feed him for the 3 days I'm not there. Of course the other 4 days I care for him. She knows what and when to feed him, and how to feed him. I have two sisters, but one is going on the trip with us. The other one is an idiot, and she's evil. I DON'T trust her AT ALL with him. My mom just says "Oh it will be ok. She can feed him." I don't trust her, at all. She doesn't like me either. I don't want to come home to my only pet that's dead. Please don't suggest having an other family member do it, because no one will. Also, don't suggest a pet sitter, because I'm not allowing a stranger to come in to my house and then my room. Thanks

TITLE:  Can I get rid of my over developed thigh muscle caused by ballet?
BODY: I'm 16 and have been doing ballet for 2 years. I have hyperextended knees and I've noticed since doing ballet my thighs have got considerable bigger. My ballet teacher says it's because of the shape of my back, hips and legs. My thigh musicale has to stretch from my hips (which sit further back because I have an arched back) then over my fema and to my knees which hyperextended causing the muscle to be bigger. It has grown because of the constant extending of the leg in ballet. I just wondered if there's any way I can get rid of my thighs and tone/slim them down a bit? My ballet teacher says I can't and it's just how they are but I'm becoming very self conscious because although I don't want to be a ballet dancer I do that I would like to be a performer in the West End and big thighs don't exactly fit the image? I only started ballet for a bit of technique to help with my jazz etc. Thanks

TITLE:  Do you like my sister's poem?
BODY: She is ten btw.

Maybe a smile crossed her face, showing her clear white teeth,
But it is all a lie, the horrid truth underneath.
Maybe cameras clicked as she blew the photographers a kiss,
As she pretended her life was happiness and bliss.

Maybe a she showed off her artificial smile,
But maybe her life was bad, she wanted to run from it, further than a mile.
Maybe she suffered from a bad case of fear.
Maybe she was all an intrepid lie and she wouldn't let it show, not a tear.

No one is happy, even toddlers have anxiety.
Because today everything is messed up especially society,

Then when I went to check on my fish tank one African butterfly fish was dead because all of his fins were bit off and the other one was alive but lots of his fins were gone who do you think did that? I have a rosealine shark, 1 Apollo shark, 2 jumbo danios, 3 hatchet fish, 1 black ghost knife fish, 2 giant pearl gouramis and a pink tail chalceus. I think it's the gouramis or the pink tail chalceus.

BODY: I got four pet rats a week ago from someone that wanted to rehome them.I had no signs of allergies to them and have been handling them since the first day. However, yesterday I noticed that my eyes were a little red/puffy and last night my arm started itching. I woke up today feeling extremely itchy, mostly on my arms, chest, and stomach but as well as my neck, the back of my hands, and my sides. I never got at all itchy handling them before. Could it be something else? I also have a pet rabbit but I've had her for 10 months now and never had any allergies to her. Aside from the rats, nothing is new.

TITLE:  Can a blender break if you put ice?
BODY: Okay so this may seem weird and all but I wanted to make a smoothie so I put all of my ingredients and when I was putting in the ice my mom stopped me. She said that she had put ice in several other blenders, and each time it broke, forcing her to get a new one. She also said that on the first day nothing abnormal happens, but on the second day it just doesn't work. But if you watch TV shows, videos, and other stuff you understand that this isn't the case as everyone adds ice in their blender and it does not break. Idk what's wrong so I'd really appreciate an answer. Thank you!!

BODY: Seven days ago I fell and hit my head on a rock. Now I have a bump on my forehead thats not very tall, is only a tiny bit bruised and it takes up about one third of my forehead above my right eyebrow and the area around my eye hurts a bit. The bump itself is slightly painful to the touch and I can feel a bit of pressure or something like that in the swollen area. Im not experiencing any other symptoms, but Ive read that some symptoms of a serious head injury can be delayed up to several days. Could this still be a serious injury or not? I went to the doctor for a check up and she said that I look fine and that there is no need for a CT or MRI, but I read that people can appear fine for days and even weeks after the injury even though they have a bleeding in their brain. Am I gonna be fine? Im a bit scared right now

TITLE:  Cat hates friend? What do I do?
BODY: Me and my friend are close and we see each other 4 days a week. We do have quite alot of things in common. We share secrets and we gossip. I have her on Facebook and Instagram and we chat there alot as well as in real life. My parents adopted a cat for me because I am so lonely with no bros or sisters. The cat was at a fair price and it looks cute and fluffy. Not to mention, friendly. This cat stayed with us for 2 weeeks, and they brought this cat home in July. This cat is calm and she causes barely any trouble. I named her Alle. Orange, cute cat. 
It all changed when my friend visited me yesterday, and Alle was unfriendly and aggressive. Alle scratched my friend's leg and bit her so hard. My friend didn't do anything but all she got was my cat being mean to her for no reason. Alle tried scratching me when I tried to defend my friend. No use. Alle bit my mother when she distracted her. Alle hissed at my father when he took her outside in the backyard. I've never seen a cat like Alle before. My friend is 18 and knows how to drive. I am 17 and know how to drive. My friend drove off and later texted me saying that this was a strange first experience with a cat. Now I think my friend is afraid of cats. :'( Today me and my friend kept texting about yesterday. I texted her saying ' I'm sorry, it was a bad first impression. Alle is a good cat but she changed when you came over. ' She understood and told me about going to her house instead for the 2 friend party.

TITLE:  Tattoo scabbing &amp; pealing months later?
BODY: So I have tattoos everywhere. Been getting them for about 13 years. I recently did a piece on my outer calf in two sessions. The second being the color. It seemed to heal a little rough. Hurt more than any other tattoo I ever had. I attributed that to it being the same leg that I had done ACL reconstructive surgery on.

After the normal healing time it seemed fine. looked great. My skin has always healed well. 

I went back about a month ago to do a piece on the inside of my calf and had noticed that the skin on the outer part of my calf on the bottom of the tattoo had to peal again. Though it may have been sunburn or something so I hit it with lotion for a few days. A couple of days later it started to scab and peal more. Only on the green/red/orange parts of it. 

It does not necessarily dry out. The scab seems to be somewhat moist. If i peal it, its completely fine skin underneath. If I wait a few more days it starts again. 

The piece on the inside of my calf has healed fine since.


Completely lost..

TITLE:  Introducing 2 aquariums of fish together?
BODY: Hello, I just got a used, 55 gallon, free aquarium from a friend yesterday, which came with all the supplies, fish, stand, lights, gravel and 2 statues. However, I also have a 10 gallon which I am transferring to that tank as well, because the fish are outgrowing it.

My question is, is it safe to introduce that tank of goldfish with her fish at the same time after I set up the new tank? I heard fish get too stressed when they are introduced to others too fast, and what's worse is that they will be stressed from the move. I cant wait to put the 10 gallon in because the 55 is going where it is, so is there a safe way to do this? like take water from each tank and put it in the other tank so they get use to them through water?

Also, would I be able to use the gravel already in the tank, or do I need to get new gravel?

TITLE:  Should new sunglasses with the same prescription cause headaches and nausea?
BODY: I have new sunglasses. They are the supposed to the exact same prescription as my regular glasses (I'm nearsighted (Right eye, -3.5/-.75/20, Left eye, -3.75/-.25/155). I put on the sunglasses, which have a gradient tint, and I feel a bit uneven, not completely off the rails, but a bit unsettled. It is causing mild nausea and some headaches too and if left on, I feel it would get worse not better. The problem also to me is that, why should I leave them on? They are sunglasses. I'm not expecting to wear them all the time. I would anticipate a seamless transition from my regular glasses with the same prescription to my sunglasses. I expect them to wear them when I'm out, and slip my regular ones back on as soon as I head indoor somewhere.

I've worn prescription glasses for 20 years. I don't have any experience with prescription sunglasses though, so I'm out of my element. I'd know what to expect from regular glasses, not sure if it's the exact same with sunglasses.

So, my question is, when there has been no change in prescription strength to get used to, should there be an adjustment period with switching between regular and sunglasses? I'd like answers only from current or former eyecare professionals. Thanks

TITLE:  Something is eating my fish...?
BODY: I have or better yet had nine fish in my take. Six neon and three glofish. And one neon just died. By the way it looked something was eating it. The glofish looked sickly but not eaten. Now one of the last two glofish is missing some of its tail, spinning constantly trying to swim. I'm thinking it has to be the pink glofish picking at them since we never had this problem up until we added that kind of fish. Can someone please help me here. I'm thinking about taking it to the pet store before the others are bothered but I don't know if it is actually doing anything..
   There are also snails in the take we are trying to get rid of. would that have any affect on them...?
thanks in advance.

TITLE:  Baby kittens found dead on street?
BODY: I know this is heart-wrenching but I found a litter of 5 kittens found dead on the street. How I found is when I was driving to my favorite store of all time, the street to the left of the store was empty. I saw a big pile of 5 white creatures, but as I got closer it was very noticeable that they were kittens. I was shocked and sad. There were a few houses down the street and no cars visible. I wondered why and how they got there. I even saw flies and dirt on them. I'm not sure if they were thrown on the street like that to die or somebody actually squished them with their tires. That was 7 hours ago. That was more like in the morning, I'm back from that store and I am still saddened by that experience as I'm an animal lover. It has been hours and I'm still thinking about them, right now is in the afternoon. Oh gosh, I wonder if they were lost from home...

TITLE:  Ball python striking?
BODY: I've heard a lot of things about ball pythons being docile but lately mine has been striking at me and anyone who tries to pick her up. I was gone last week but my stepdad held her a few times so she would be okay when I held her again. All of her temperatures are okay but I haven't had time to take her to the vet just yet. It will probably be sometime around the week after next week. She's eating a small mouse because when I got her she was under fed and today she will most likely be eating rat pups. I'm leaving again tomorrow but I'm feeding her today. She hasnt struck at anyone the first time we got her but now she is. Usually she strikes one time and you can leave her alone for a few minutes and then pick her up. But today when I tried to pick her up ( I held her on Wednesday and it's Friday ) she struck three times but didn't bite me once. It starting to make me scared of her and I don't want to be scared of my snake. I also have to feed her today so I'm going to have to take her out of her enclosure. Any help?

BODY: I bought a Russian dwarf hamster 1-2 weeks ago. She hasn't ever bitten me or anyone, except for one time where my helper hit her on accident. She's a real sweetheart. She doesn't really show interest in her chew toys, only in a mineral chew I give her to ensure her teeth don't grow too long. She walks onto my hands sometime. Is she tame, or just really sweet in nature? How does a tame hamster act like? Also, she has never seemed to mind me petting her a lot when she's eating.

TITLE:  How can I improve this poem?
BODY: My girlfriend has her birthday coming up in a few days. I decided to write her a poem. I don't think I'm that great in writing, but I thought I would give it a shot. 

Her name is "Fajer" which means Dawn in arabic. 

From the moment we met, 
I knew you were special. 
A spark ignited my empty soul, 
You brighten my day, you are the dawn. 

Love is a battle, 
Fear of the unknown, you have to soldier on. 
For every kingdom needs a king, 
And every king needs his queen. 
Together, we can fight through any war, 
Build our own empire and conquer it all. 

For what I know is this; 
Every breath I take is for you, 
Deeper than the ocean blue 
Pure, gentle and true. 
The world is our oyster,

TITLE:  What should I do if I find a stray kitten with a little bit of blood on its belly?
BODY: I was sitting outside on the back patio of my moms work, &amp; I noticed a little grey kitten who was obviously a stray, and it had a couple spots of blood on it. Of course, my first instinct was to try &amp; get it, since I somehow thought that was going to be easy. The little kitten darted off, &amp; ran underneath a deck. So I went back to my moms work, &amp; asked if they had some cat food, luckily they did because they feed other stray cats &amp; kittens. I grabbed canned young cat food, poured it into a bowl, grabbed a bowl of water and set it down about 10 feet away from the cat, &amp; walked away. I stayed out of sight watching the little kitty, &amp; it gobbled up all the food &amp; water in seconds. The poor kitten was not only bleeding, it was starving. It allowed me to inch my way about 5 feet away, &amp; I thought I might be able to grab it but it darted off again... I want to help this cat, but I can't get a hold of it. Any advice will help at this point..

I told her about some cleansers, toners, that I use but her mom is worried that it may ruin her skin in the future because she is young.
Are there any facial cleansers/toners out there that may be safe and suitable for a preteen?

TITLE:  Hair question?
BODY: Im 15. 16 in 2 months. Im african american with slight white in me but not really. Im a light dark skinned girl and so are my parents. My hair is dark dark brown, almost looks black. My mom has put relaxers in my hair ever since i was younger because she didnt want to deal with it being nappy so now i dont have curly hair. Its more like stringy and wavy and when it dries it just dries to look like i just blow dried it. So yeah, i dont wear it wet much. 1) i was wondering if anyone has hair type like mine and knows of any products i could use to keep my hair looking nice and not drying out or getting crunchy when its wet. 2) i want to get an ombre effect on my hair with a caramel color . I wanted to know if anyone with relaxed hair like mine has ever put color in there hair like an ombre effect, not touching the roots and was able to get relaxers again and if not, what could i use on my hair since it will be more hard to manage without a relaxer? Thanks. I put a picture up of my natural hair and my hair when i straighten it and the type of ombre i want. They are kinda bad pictures but oh well.

TITLE:  Subconjunctival hemorrhage (blood on white eye)? Antibiotic Medication Drops Required or not?
BODY: 3 days ago, I woke up and saw red blood on the white portion of my left eye. I really got scared. When i went to my doctor, he said it is is a subconjunctival hemorrhage. He prescribed me eye drops (Maxitrol) which contains anti-biotic and steroid. I am not using any medications and 3 days have passed, now it looks like that the blood is spreading. Earlier it was just a spot and now it has spread and touching my cornea.

I have been reading on the internet that in the condition of subconjunctival hemorrhage there is no medication required and it goes away on its own. So, I want to ask if I should use the eye drops? are there any side-effects of steroid medications? If i don't use the drops, will it  go away or not? I am so worried. Please help me out.

TITLE:  How to convience my parents to let me dye my hair green/blue?
BODY: Hello, I am 17 years old. I am turning 18 in two months and my mom still doesn't want me to dye my hair. I'm moving to go to college (very artsy college) in two weeks and my mom is still against it. She is a very prim and proper preppy wanna be type woman. I told her that I've been wanting to do this for years and that now is the perfect time because I don't have to worry about jobs, or her reputation. The only reason I'm not just saying screw it, and doing it anyways is because she's helping out financially. I view dying my hair as a way to express myself and to do and to be what I like. (emphasis on the I!) Her argument is that I have "beautiful red hair" but hey, Sure red hairs nice sometimes, but how's that any different from someone with brown hair dying it?? its going to come out eventually! 

Long story short, how can I talk her into letting me dye MY hair?

BODY: I was told I have aggressive periodontitis and I have a couple of back teeth that I need the gym opened up and cleaned. Insurance doesn t seem to cover grafts and membranes so it s quite expensive. I m not extracting a tooth just opening up the gum to clean it and there was some bone loss. Can I live without the membrane and bone graft ? Is it enough for the dentist to just go in and clean it and close it back up?

These are all Outbound traffic requests. This one right now states the following:

Remote computer: 72-62-48-77.pools.spcsdns.net (72.62.48.77)

What do you think this is? Microsoft, or some hack using Microsoft? Thank you very much!

TITLE:  My turtle isn't growing. Any advice to help?
BODY: Hello. I am a happy owner of 2 turtles. One is a RES and the other is a painted turtle. The painted turtle's name is Leo. He doesn't seem to be growing nor eating. The other one is growing fine and is eating his food. I am very concerned because my parents do not want to take it to the vet and I don't know whether to feed him or not because I don't want the other turtle to eat his food rather than Leo, leading to the other one becoming overweight. Both don't really seem to be very active either. I have a filter, a nice hot light, a dock, and usually clean water for them. 
       Hopefully one of you can help me. Note: I like awarding best answers to long, detailed, helpful answers, from an experienced turtle owner or vet. Thank you!

BODY: And the reason it's expanding is because matter is getting larger and more matter is being turned into other things? Like when you have water and the more things you put in it, the more is expands. Could this be a theory why it is expanding?

TITLE:  How can I prevent side stitches?
BODY: I get side stitches like 2 minutes into a slow jog, no matter what I try. Here are some things I've tried

- hydration before running but not too closely before
- not eating within 1-2 hours of running
- steady breathing and running
- slowly building up speed
- exhaling when a certain opposite foot hits the ground
- purse breathing

Could it be because I'm not used to jogging as I am out of shape, or because I have a rather weak core? Should I just keeps doing what I'm doing and get used to it? Please answers from experienced runners.

BODY: I never played any sport in high school or college, which I really regret now. I'm in the Army and have really started to take a liking to running. 

I've gotten decent at it, not quite enough to compete, but I could if I shifted my focus to just running. I have no clue how the NCAA rules work, and the website is very confusing in answering it. Does anybody have any experience with this, or have an answer?

I've tried changing my shampoos, including excluding some ingredients such as sodium lathate. I don't want to wash my hair everyday because that's not good for your hair. I don't eat oily food either, Also I have tried using different hair masks and natural shampoos but they make hair twice as greasy. I need help!!

TITLE:  Broken foot question Plz Help?
BODY: I fractured my fifth metatarsal 3 weeks ago, when i went to the hospital the doctor gave me an aircast and told me to start walking with the aircast as soon as possible. Its now week 3 and im walking in the aircast with no pain at all. Ive tried walking without the aircast on as well and there is little to no pain. The foot is still swollen  but has gone down significantly since the actual day I fractured it. I have an appointment at the hospital in 10 days on july 27th, do you think i will be able to start wlaking normally in my shoes on that date? And also i have a trip to greece august 16 will my foot be good for my trip? I am an 18 year old male and have been keeping my foot elevated as instructed. Thanks for reading!

TITLE:  Did braces help you?
BODY: Okay so I have braces and I've had them for 2 years already and I'm scheduled to get them off in 4 weeks and I'm scared they didn't help me at all. Okay so when I look at them closely they look waaay better than they did before.. But when I smile I don't like my smile and I'm scared I'm still not going to like it when I get them off and all the money my parents spent on them would just be a waste. I don't know if it's just because I haven't seen what my teeth look like without metal on them in a long time or?... Did anyone else feel like this before they got them off? Thanks!!!

BODY: On the first day I wash my hair, it looks fine. On the second day, my scalp looks so greasy and disgusting. I don't want to wash it everyday since it's bad for your hair. I don't use conditioner, could this be the problem? I don't think it is because you aren't supposed to put the conditioner on your scalp. Some shampoos will make my hair twice as greasy and it's awful. Any suggestions?

And he is really active and eats A LOT and runs around all the time, so I don t think he s sick. Maybe just overeating. Should I go to the vet? Is this normal? Will he grow out of it?

TITLE:  Help me choose 1 from these 2 builds!!!?
BODY: So I am planning to build a Gaming PC for my self. I will be playing games like GTA 5, AC Unity, Far Cry 4, Dying Light, The Wolf Among Us and etc at max settings at 1080p. I need help choosing 1 of these 2 builds and I wonder if someone experienced could help me.

Build #1 :
MSI Z97 Pro Gaming 5
Intel i5 4690k 
MSI GTX 970 
8 gb Corsair Vengence 
Corsair CS 650
NZXT S340 Black (I already ordered the case)

Build #2
MSI H97 Gaming 3
Intel i5 4460
MSI GTX 980
8 gb Corsair Vengence 
Corsair CS 650
NZXT S340 Black

I considered asking this question and actually coming up with the second build when I thought that the 3.5 gigs of VRAM in the GTX 970 is not gonna help me in the long run (like 3-4 years) I will be sticking with a 1080p display or maybe even a lower one but nothing higher.
Do you guys think that the GTX 970's 3.5 gig is gonna make me buy a new GPU with more RAM after 2-3 years?
BTW.... which one should I go with?
Keeping in mind that I will not be doing any overclocking or video editing, the second build seems a little more appealing to me. But keep in mind that I will be doing some sort of Music Production not to crazy 68 tracks but yes some moderate work on audio production.

Thanks In ADVANCE!

ADDITION :
If I got the overclockable build then I would surely swap in a AIO water cooler or a good quality air cooler and do a little of overclocking.

TITLE:  Which series of Nvidia cards offer triple monitor support?
BODY: Specifically for extended desktop.  

I'm aware of the Surround tech for gaming, but it seems that triple monitor support for Nvidia goes back to about 2009 or so, which predates the Surround technology, but I can't figure out if there's another trademark for just basic triple monitor support that I can search for, or if I'm stuck going through every single model of card for the last 7 years to see if it supports 3 monitor extended desktop.

Also, does Nvidia triple monitor setup require a displayport for the 3rd monitor like ATI does?

BODY: I have 30 day disposable contact lenses. Often times I just don t feel like dealing with them so I will only wear them if I need to go out and drive somewhere. So at the end of the 30 day period I may have only actually used them 20 times. Do I still need to switch them out or can I stretch them to a month and a half as long as I don t use them more than 30 times? I am very good about my contact routine as well. Never sleep in them, change solution every day, give them a good rub, wash out the case with gentle soap. I am an optometrists dream patient!

TITLE:  How is this chipped tooth gonna change my life?
BODY: I chipped just the back side of my bottom front tooth biting finger nails. It wasnt noticeable since it was in the back but it made the tooth pretty thin at the top and was not sure if it would break the tipif I ate with it so got it dental bonded. So with my chipped in the back tooth and dental bonding covering it, what will change with my life? If bonding wears away would I just be ablento keep the chip naked without new bonding? Will my quality of life diminish or my hobbies be affected? I sing and fight martial arts. I like knowing I have strong teeth it makes my whole body feel strong I hope this chunk in back of tooth missing wont change things and make me less effective in life (which if my tooth is weaker then I am less effective somehow and people that have stronger teeth are better off) Also dont want it to affect my voice. But its not like a broken leg, gone blind, or cancer. It feels like it does have some affect on me and my abilities though so how will this chip change my life?

TITLE:  How to stop my rat attacking other rats?
BODY: I originally had 4 rats, 2 of them constantly fought for alpha (Oscar and Peanut) but they never touched the other 2 and then I got rid of the 2 that they didn t attack and Oscar and Peanut stopped fighting for a while, they d have the odd scrap but no where near as brutal as before.
THEN I bought a new baby rat called Doobie! He isn t big enough to defend himself but all of a sudden Oscar has became this vicious rat that he s never been before!! Any chance he gets he ll attack the baby! I have the baby in a separate cage but I want to put him in the cage with the others as he has really warmed to Peanut and Peanut is so placid with him. 
Oscar has even started attacking Peanut again, he literally takes chunks out of him to the point where he is almost bald on his back. He hasn t bit me yet but I can tell his whole personality has changed, he is usually very gentle but today he snatched a treat out of my hand and ran away which he never does! I can t switch oscar and doobie s cage because Oscar is too small for the little cage and I can t keep Doobie in the small cage forever because he is rapidly growing! Someone please give me advice I hate seeing my boys like this 😔😔😔

TITLE:  Do contact lenses get easier the longer you where them?
BODY: So I got a trial pair of contacts and HOLY CRAP it was torture when the employee was teaching me to put them on and off. I was all but crying and my eyes were really red, and it took me almost an hour to practice putting them in and taking them out for each eye. And when I removed them later on, my eyes still teared up like crazy and got really red from barely touching them. My left eye actually stung and I had to YouTube a tutorial on removing them easier.

While I was wearing them though, it didn't feel that bad. I think my eyes are dry though, because even after a couple of hours I could still feel them (like there was an eyelash in my eye) and I would have to blink repeatedly to make the sensation wear off.

So yeah. Day 1 of wearing contacts was not easy. Do they get easier?

Any help would be appreciated!

TITLE:  Can I begin to add fish to my new tank?
BODY: I am brand new to fish keeping and I have a 15 gallon tank and have had all the decorations, rocks and gravel, fake plants, water and filter running for 3 weeks now. I just added a little heater, though I'm not sure I need one. I replaced the water that had evaporated and added the water conditioner. 
I just tried the liquid test kits and my pH was 8.2, Ammonia and Nitrite were both at 0. 
Is my tank done cycling? If so when can I put my fish in and how many at a time? I am going to start off with the minimum number of 5 Glofish, though I might add more later on, and a few ghost shrimp to help keep everything clean. 
Any advice would be great thanks!

I have mild acne, my hair is frizzy and curly (I need a good haircut as well, any suggestions are welcome), my eyebrows are slightly messy as well. I have dark brown eyes, a rounded heart shaped face, and my lips are slightly on the thin side. Any suggestions are welcome. I'm open to styling my hair and very very light minimal makeup. Thank you!

TITLE:  HELP! back pain! back strain or herniated/slipped disc?
BODY: so i was at work pulling palletes out of a truck, and the pallet got stuck, so i tried pushing it back, when i heard a few cracks or pops/buckling, and i involuntarily leaned forward a bit, and was literally locked in place, i could not move for about 5 seconds. although the process wasnt painful, a few minutes later back pain started. it's been 9 days now and it hasn't gotten any better. i went to doctor and he said probably muscular and it will be gone in 4 days. No bruising or anythin noticable on my back pain doesnt radiate into legs, but i read for slipped disc it doesnt have to. and it hurts when i bend over and return back. it especially hurts when i try to pick up anything heavy but i can lean my full body weight on the counter on my arms without any pain. hurts when i jump, or go down stairs. when i sit in the car and recline, i can pull myself up while holding on to the steering wheel and not engaging my back muscles without any pain or very little, but if i stop halfway and begin to use my back, the pain comes back hard. so is this a slipped disc, or muscle strain or is it a sprain or something else? im getting worried im only 19 and i dont want back problems.

BODY: When I first saw this Google Chrome extension called Coupmania, it has been bringing up ads wherever I go on the web. I uninstalled the extension, but the next day, Coupmania reappeared. I uninstalled it again and removed the folder for that extension from my computer, but it keeps coming back everyday I try to remove it. I tried using malwarebytes to find and get rid of the extension, I tried looking for the source of the extension using developer mode, and tried to uncheck the box of the extension, but nothing works, and Coupmania just comes back regardless of my actions to get rid of it.

Is there anyway to permanently remove Coupmania?

BODY: she now has no down left and hasn't had any for a long time. it seems like it's getting worse: she's going after her skin even more, to the point where she's making herself bleed. all of the little coats that you could put on her would help some, but she goes after her shoulders and parts of her wings! i don't know what to do or how to make her stop

TITLE:  Male Betta in a community tank?
BODY: I have a 65 gallon tank and I have about 3 guppies, 3 swordtails, 6 neon tetras. 
I had an incident where a fish went and ate 12 of my fish (that's why it is so understocked) 
Anyways. I was wondering in such a big and understocked tank if I could have a MALE betta? The tank has many rocks and driftwood and plants, I might add some caves. I know Berta's should typically be alone but in such a huge tank would it be okay? 

I'm interested in trying it. I also have a spare 5 gallon in case things don't work out :) 

Any tips?

Is there anything I can do to get them whiter? My mom was saying that she would think about me getting it done professionally but i don't know if that would damage my teeth or something?

Thanks in advance

I've had local before when I've been to the dentist and I didn't feel a thing. But this is a prosecute where the gums are brought back and the tooth is revealed, will this hurt during the procedure with local anaesthetic ?
It probably sounds silly but I'm just worried and nervous about it. Thanks.

TITLE:  How to make my permed hair look curly/natural?
BODY: *Sorry if this is badly worded..

So my hair is permed and after I wash it I usually blow dry it and use my straightener, but this week I started softball practice and where I live its superrr hot and at practice I get sweaty and my hair gets puffy from the sweat.

The other day after the water park, I washed my hair but instead of using my regular shampoo and conditioner I used some that's made/makes your hair curlier and some spray for curly hair. (I didn't want to straighten it cause sweating would just ruin most of it. especially on the ends of my hair.)  I also braided my hair while it was damp to make it kinky and stuff but how do I keep my hair like this?


(I'm a little overdue for a perm so theres a lot of new-growth in my hair, that's another reason I don't want to straighten it, it will look weird.)

What i'm saying is, do I have to re-braid and dampen my hair every night or is there an easier way?
**I used the products in the picture minus the enhancing smoothie stuff

TITLE:  Question on antique porcelain pitcher.?
BODY: My grandmother passed away about 3 years ago and I after a recent move I was looking at some of the items she left that were in storage.  I found this pitcher that my mom said belonged to my grandmothers grandmother so I guess my great great grandmother, possibly further back than that though.  My mom said probably in the 1800's. 

All I've been able to find was some history on who I believe was the potter, George Phillips.  The thing is the seal on it looks different than the one he used, unless he used others.  Also my grandmothers family is from Germany back in the 1800's.  Originally there was a basin that came with it but I'm told that piece broke.  I'm just interested in the history of it, if it was made by the potter I think then he was pretty common, still nice to have some history on the family antiques.

Here are a few photos.  Also if anyone can give me advice on cleaning it.  It just seems dirty or maybe some type of aging on it and it won't come clean.  I'm afraid to use anything too harsh.

TITLE:  Are some cats just a lost cause with litter taining? please see my delemia below.?
BODY: I have a kitten, I got her when she was just 6 weeks old. she is not about 9-10 months only. I cant get her to stop pooping and peeing outside the litter box. I have tried everything. I have used sprays. I have used the boot camp method where I keep her in the bathroom and put the food and bed in the tub but she will poop right next to her food. The only way she will use the little box is if there is water in the tub and she is kept in the bathroom. Every time I let her out she poops and pees else where. She cant stay in the bathroom especially since now she is just peeing and pooing everywhere in the bathroom. The thing I dont get is that I keep the little box clean. I clean it twice a day! She is a beautiful cat and is very nice and purrs so easily. I dont want to give her to the humane society, but im feeling I have no choice. Oh and she doesnt have a track infection.

TITLE:  Do air cast s only go on a specific foot?
BODY: I have an avulsion fracture in my ankle, and I have the option of being in an air cast or a plaster cast. I can t really afford the air cast right now, and the plaster cast is covered by insurence. However, my friend has an air cast that she wore on her left ankle and my injury is on the right. Are they specified and only fit one ankle? Thanks

TITLE:  Anyone know about broken bones?
BODY: I fractured my fifth metatarsal 3 weeks ago, when i went to the hospital the doctor gave me an aircast and told me to start walking with the aircast as soon as possible. Its now week 3 and im walking in the aircast with no pain at all. Ive tried walking without the aircast on as well and there is little to no pain. The foot is still swollen  but has gone down significantly since the actual day I fractured it. I have an appointment at the hospital in 10 days on july 27th, do you think i will be able to start wlaking normally in my shoes on that date? And also i have a trip to greece august 16 will my foot be good for my trip? I am an 18 year old male and have been keeping my foot elevated as instructed. Thanks for reading!

BODY: I have a pregnant female degu and a Male degu that got along perfectly fine until lately... My female degu started to attack the male. At first I left them in there thinking they would just stop in a few minutes but when I came back there was blood everywhere. The female has blood and scratches all around her face and the male does too. 
I separated them and now he Is in a different cage but I want to know if it is only because of her being pregnant or if they will never get along again. I just feel bad that they are alone now..

TITLE:  Can Red Zebra Cichlids Clone Themselves?
BODY: I have a red zebra cichlid who is carrying eggs in her mouth again...but she hasn't been with any other cichlids for several months. The REASON for that is because she kills any tankmates with her, same size or larger. She killed her previous mate when they bred the first time, and then killed the other two cichlids who were bigger than her. So yeah, she's been a lone, I tried to put her with some others that were larger and she mauled them two days later...I feel bad she's alone, but she wont allow me to make her a school. 

Anyways, she has eggs in her mouth again, can they store sperm, or clone like some other fish species? Or is she perhaps holding out for a male I wont be putting with her because my one beautiful boy is in his own group that doesn't kill everyone else and is much smaller than her. lol

TITLE:  Question about Siamese cats?
BODY: Hi,
I have a question for you Siamese owners. Now I am a huge Siamese cat lover and they are my absolute favorite breed but every time I say that I'm really wanting to get one, family and friends always tell me not to because cancer is very common in the breed. This not only turned me off but it did even more after my 3 year old Persian/Siamese mix had pasted away due to cancer. My question is this, IS cancer in fact a popular illness in the breed?

Please only respond if you've actually owned a purebred Siamese or you've talked to those who have owned one and not a shelter cat that just so happens to look like one.

BODY: I just saved a betta fish from a fair that I went to. He looks healthy, if not happy, and is eating some frozen brine shrimp I have to him in the little ""tank"" he came in. I have five other betta fish which all have their own five gallon tanks. However, this veil tail male has nowhere to go but an empty, cycled 29 gallon aquarium that I set up a while ago. It has three live plants, some rocks, and black sand at the bottom, plus a filter. It doesn't have a heater because it's in my room, which stays at a steady 78 degrees Fahrenheit. Can he go in a tank this large? The ammonia is 0, nitrites 0, nitrates 0.5, pH 7.4. Thank you!

TITLE:  Can I upgrade to the GTX 980?
BODY: My computer (from what i could find) is: https://www.asus.com/us/Desktops/CM1855/specifications/

Or, specifications I see from System/Ccleaner:

Windows 8.1
ASUS Desktop PC CM1855 Series
AMD FX(tm)-8300 Eight-Core Processor 3.30GHz
AMD Radeon HD 7600 Series
8.00 GB RAM
64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor

I'm not that good when it comes to graphics cards, so I would like some help e.e With Fallout 4 coming soon, it gave me that little push I need to try for the best to be able to run it at maximum graphics. 

Would it be possible to install a GTX 980? Are there other parts I would need to upgrade as well to compensate? If so can I get a few links to the parts as well? If I can't upgrade to a GTX 980 is there anything else within the range of ~$650 and below that would work just as good? Also, not just for Fallout 4, everything in general xD Thanks in advance~

TITLE:  Would a betta be compatible with three red phantom tetras?
BODY: I currently have a betta fish, which I ve had for about 2 years now, in a bowl by himself and have read time and again that they require more swimming space than a bowl can provide. I also have three red phantom tetras in a tank of their own (approx. 6 gallons). I was wondering if the betta can be transferred to the tank with the tetras and be compatible.

Any information and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

TITLE:  Do I need to go get an eye exam?
BODY: Im 15 and im a hardcore gamer. Its summer so all I do at my moms is play on my computer with 2 monitors. My eyes were suddenly straining never before had this problem. So I figured since I was out of school it was my lack of doing other stuff and just playing so I took a break. About 3 days I believe. When I got back on I'd say in a matter of 2 hours they started straining again. So now im at my dads for the month away from my computer and I've taken about 15 days off video games and just watching tv. After watching a movie my eyes will be a little red and strained. But when I attempted to play games again about 1 hour in their straining. And now I wanna say 45 min and their red. It might be lack of blinking for the games but tv I rarely pay attention too and I know im far enough away from it. This has never been a problem before. It was all so sudden. Should I wait until school and see if its still bad or should I go get an exam?

Srry for long

TITLE:  Hamsters fighting?
BODY: I went to a local pet store and bought a teddy bear hamster the day I graduated. About a month later he looked lonely so I decided to get him a friend of the same gender. I asked the girl from the store if two teddy bear hamsters are allowed to love together (I thought it'd be better to ask a pet shop worker thinking she would have knowledge about hamsters) and she told me that they are allowed to. I bought a pretty big cage and treats, but the first one I bought started attacking the new one. I pulled them apart from each other but it took me a whole, my hamsters had bloody paws, one had a torn ear, and a few small marks on their back. I looked up online to see if they can live together and many sources said no and they will fight to the death. I feel horrible and sad because I just wanted to give him a good home and instead he got attacked. Should I call the pet store and tell someone so it doesn't happen again or should I just let it be, they're currently in seperate cages. Also, should I take them to the vet? They're walking, eating, playing and stuff but I don't want them to be in pain.

TITLE:  Did I sprain my foot?
BODY: I was at worlds of fun yesterday, and while walking to the Americana area, I wasn't paying attention and stepped a little too far (the ground suddenly became steep) and I fell. When I was falling I felt my ankle twist around a few times, once my mom, sister and I got to somewhere we could sit down, I felt my ankle starting to hurt really bad. My mom got ice for it because it did start to swell (not that bad, but a little) and I put it on for about 10 minutes and then we continued walking. My foot hurt all through out the day (I continued to walk on it for about 5 more hours) and when we were done, I got into the car and noticed a little bit of bruising. It bruised around the outside of my ankle (like a subtle brown/pink colour) and on the inside (a dark brown, not bad though) and near the outside like towards my toes and the bottom of my foot (purple-ish). The bruised aren't THAT noticeable and I can still walk on my foot (it just hurts a lot and I limp) and I know my parents won't take me to a doctor because they think it's minor. But it's about a day later and it still hurts and gets a tiny bit swollen from time to time.

TITLE:  What are some foods to eat post wisdom teeth surgery?
BODY: I have 4 wisdom teeth to be taken out in one surgery in four days. I know that the main go-to foods are mashed potatoes and milkshakes, but I was wondering if there are any foods that I may not be thinking of that I could eat and not have to chew too much. Any other tips for this type of thing would be awesome too :)

Thank you for taking time to answer my question!

TITLE:  Home remedies for rat uri?
BODY: my rat is squeaking quietly and jerking with each breath, she also has a little bit of porphyrin on her nose. As i hold her for longer it becomes less pronounced and she doesn't want to go back to her cage. so i could be that, or she could be cold. her fur is all fluffed up when it took her outside (where it is currently over 90F) she gets more energetic but that could also be because she doesn't get to go out often.
I want to take her to a vet, but my parents don't think it's worth the money for a pet that will probably only live a year or two more, and i'm not old enough to take her myself.
So overall, is there any common household or walmart item i can get her or anything i can do to help her?

Lately I've been flossing around the area /brushing it more than I usually do and now it seems like it's become more tender than before. Before when I brushed my teeth I woudln't even feel the tenderness but now when I do I can. What is this and what should I do about it? Do I need to see a dentist asap?

TITLE:  Ten day old kittens...?
BODY: I am hand raising three ten day old kittens, abandoned by their mom.  They appear healthy:  Have doubled in size, feeding well on kitten formula now every 3-4 hours.  My problem is I m worried about if they are pooping frequently enough.  The first few days they passed yellowish, soft formed stools just about every time I stimulated their bottoms.  They urinate welland are feeding well.  Their belts are round and soft, no tenderness.  The past few days they aren t pooping nearly as often, maybe once a day...And haven t yet pooped today.  Poop is still yellowish but very soft, and more or less just smears when I wipe them.  How often should they be pooping now, what consistency should it be?  They don t like me wrong their bottoms and meow very loudly when I do.    Any advice appreciated!!  When should I worry???

Also another problem ive had is my psu fan never turns on and ive read online and it says it only comes on when my computer is hot. But is there a way i can turn it on anyway i read online and can only find stuff about that paperclip trick but i need to turn on the fan while im running the pc. Its a evga nex750G psu.

TITLE:  Savvy computer people, I need your help with my next gaming computer.?
BODY: First and foremost I want to let everyone know that I know little to nothing about computers and that is why I need your help. Help me decide on my next gaming computer. I want to spend no more than $700/$800. I just want the best bang for my buck on this computer. I know with this amount of money it wont run on the highest setting on most new games, but I don't need it to. I just want a good gaming desktop computer.

I was really tempted to pull the trigger on this Alien Alpha on amazon for 599
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MA7AFDI?tag=digitren08-20

The specs look good, but since I know little to nothing on computers I might be wrong.

I was also looking at this model as well 
http://www.dell.com/us/p/alienware-x51-r2/pd?oc=dpcwxy01s&amp;model_id=alienware-x51-r2

I know Alienware tends to be overpriced, but that Alpha one on amazon looks like a good deal. I don't favor any brand. So if you can let me know whats the best bang. It could be one of these two computers or a HP, Dell, a Cyber Power desktop or anything else, just let me know. 

Please lend me your advice, voice your opinion to why a certain computer is better.

TITLE:  Can you have multiple sets of teeth?
BODY: Once, I had to get three teeth pullen out of my mouth because they were stuck and my other teeth needed to come in, causing a tooth ache. Two out of three teeth turned out fine, which are right next to each other, they put a brace there to keep them straight.

That's not the point. Anyways, as I said, ONLY two out of three turned out fine. I mean, the last tooth was perfectly fine, grew in straight, no cavities. But, a little over six months later, the tooth becomes loose. And as all loose tooth go, it fell out. By this time, I was freaking out. I thought maybe, I did something wrong and I lost that tooth forever. But the tooth grew back, fortunately.

A whole year later, the tooth became loose AGAIN. It fell out, grew back, and everything was fine.

Holy mother of hell, a year later, IT FELL OUT AGAIN. Yes, it grew back.

Now, a few months after the last time, it's completely fine. Nothing has happened. ... yet. It feels pretty sturdy and strong at the moment. The thing is, only that one tooth does this. No other tooth had ever done this. I feel like a weirdo and not human when discussing this cause nobody else can ever relate.

 Is it normal? When does it occur? And, can you have multiple sets of teeth? Or am I just going crazy?

BODY: I'm leaving from LAX on October 1st at 7pm and flying non-stop to London Gatwick (LGW).  I'm scheduled to arrive in England at 1:30pm  The flight is listed as 10.5 hours.  

I'm confused because my ticket doesn't say anything about the date I'll be arriving in London.  Will I be in London on 10/1 at 1:30pm or 10/2 at 1:30?

Sorry if this question seems extremely elementary, but I'm not very experienced in International Travel.  I don't want to arrive in London and not have a place to stay on the first evening :).

TITLE:  USB Hub Questions - Transfer Rate Loss?
BODY: Hi, I recently had a thought since I use a lot of USB devices and wondered if you were to connect multiple USB 2.0 devices to a USB 3.0 hub would you loose less data transfer/power than using multiple USB 2.0 devices on a USB 2.0 hub or would it not change because of compatibility?
(This is going on the idea you are maxing out the transfer rate and power for the hub)

Thanks Nathan

TITLE:  Will my gaps ever close?
BODY: Im 13 and i have a gap between my 2 front teeth plus 1 gap on both sides of my 2 front teeth. So thats three gaps. Sadly my insurance doesnt cover braces or invisaline, and my parents cant afford anything like bands or fillers or whatever. Recently ive been having pain in my teeth but my dentist says they are growing together. The proble, is is that even if my teeth do grow together alittle, it will only close my 2 outer gaps, which means i still have 1 gap in my 2 front teeth. Is there a free way to close ALL my gaps? Or do you think they will close since im 13? thanks.

Point 2: Basketballs a team game. They played good defense on him. Good job, but LeBron still gets his 30 a game and controls the tempo of every single game

Point 3: There's a reason these guys don't have any regular season MVP's. 

Point 4: There's a reason LeBron has tons of regular season MVP's. 

Point 5: LeBron has won as many finals as both of these dudes combined

Point 6: LeBron leads his teams, these guys play roles

TITLE:  Leopard gecko bad shed aftercare specifics?
BODY: My poor babby-monster had a really bad shed a week or 2 ago--unshed skin on all 4 feet, plus the tip of her tail and a few other spots.  And I let it go a little too long (I was out of town), so I think she's taken some damage already (the tip of her tail looks funny, there's a small wound on her nose, and her toes seem to be pretty sensitive)  I've gotten the unshed skin off of everywhere but her toes, I think, but her toes are still pretty bad.  And I cannot afford a vet at this point.  (I can only afford to feed her because I have a colony of roaches for her.  Seriously, I'm that poor)

Some specific questions:

1. I've mostly been trying to handle this by giving her little baths to soften up the skin.  I've been doing this 3 or 4 times a day.  How many is too many?

2. After her baths, once a day, I try to remove some of the dead skin with an old toothbrush (from an electric toothbrush, so the bristles are fairly soft ones).  Is there any problem with me doing this?

3. Also after the baths, I've been *very* gently pulling off any unshed skin that I can get at with tweezers.  Any hazards I need to be aware of there?

4. Would hydrogen peroxide help or hurt?  Would oil (either olive oil, or regular vegetable oil) help or hurt?  Would antibiotic ointment be a good or bad idea  Any other Things I Have At Home (or can get very cheaply) that would likely help her out?

And, well, any other advice?

TITLE:  Should I take this injured cat in? Should I take it to the vet?
BODY: I live in a Rural area and I had a cat, don't know where it came from, come up to my house as a young, severely injured, kitten. So I nursed it back to health and it stuck around (surprisingly). So I feed it table scraps, and let it in during rough, or hot, weather. I had him fixed so that wouldn't be a problem (I don't like cats too much)

I was looking at the poor fella today. He is so torn to shreds. Cuts and gashes all over his body, bleeding, he can barely walk on his front leg after a spider bit him and almost killed him a while back (I shaved his leg and can conirm it was a spider - most likely a wolf or black widow. I've spent my life studying them things) so now he is partially crippled and... I just feel sorry for him and I want to take him in on a permanent basis before he gets killed. 

Thing is... I don't know if it's a good idea. I'd definitely take him to a vet, but I don't want them to think I neglected that cat or something when it's not even technically mine.

What should I do?

I'm a really good volleyball player, but I'm not the greatest in running, I get tired quickly, and I'm very insecure, and very self conscious. I'm extremely scared for next year because my sister told me they run you a lot and you have to suck it up at times, but I get very tired easily when running. What should I do?

TITLE:  Savvy computer people, I need your help with my next gaming computer.?
BODY: First and foremost I want to let everyone know that I know little to nothing about computers and that is why I need your help. Help me decide on my next gaming computer. I want to spend no more than $700/$800. I just want the best bang for my buck on this computer. I know with this amount of money it wont run on the highest setting on most new games, but I don't need it to. I just want a good gaming desktop computer.

I was really tempted to pull the trigger on this Alien Alpha on amazon for 599
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MA7A...

The specs look good, but since I know little to nothing on computers I might be wrong.

I was also looking at this model as well
http://www.dell.com/us/p/alienware-x51-r...

I know Alienware tends to be overpriced, but that Alpha one on amazon looks like a good deal. I don't favor any brand. So if you can let me know whats the best bang. It could be one of these two computers or a HP, Dell, a Cyber Power desktop or anything else, just let me know.

Please lend me your advice, voice your opinion to why a certain computer is better.

TITLE:  How can I rip cc subtitles from a video that is not uploaded on youtube?
BODY: Hey there! There is a video that is shared on google drive with closed captions on it.
The thing is, he uploaded them on google drive, and the subtitles are softsubs, meaning that when I download the (save as) video to be saved into my external drive, the subs won't be downloaded, just the video.
Now this is a big problem for me because I don't want to watch it by streaming it. I want to watch it even without internet, so I need to rip the subtitles in order to watch the video with the subtitles, on my own media player. 

Is there any way? I tried using the online ripper called Keepsubs but that only works for youtube links.

Anyway, here's a clearer picture of my problem. This is the screenshot.

TITLE:  Is my wisdom tooth extraction site normal?
BODY: I got all four of my wisdom teeth removed on Wednesday, the 15th at about 10 AM. All four were bony impacted. 
I decided to check on them, and one side looks...butchered. 
I physically feel fine (only slight pain/discomfort), I occasionally get a bloody taste (nothing funky), but it doesn't look "right" especially when compared with the other side.

(The photos were taken with flash so everything looks fairly disgusting, sorry.) 
The side that, imo, looks normal/healthy: https://flic.kr/p/vSfzpV
The side I'm worried about (please enlarge it, the compacted view ironically makes it look worse): https://flic.kr/p/vS8n4Y

So, I basically just want a second opinion before calling up the surgeon.

TITLE:  Quarter sized lump on leg. Noticeable when sitting but bulges out while standing. What could cause this?
BODY: Hello! I ve had a quarter sized lump on my left leg for almost 8 years now. It s not normally painful but occasionally it ll feel as though I am having a muscle spasm right where the lump is. I broke the same leg about 17 years ago so I don t know if breaking it could ve been part of the issue. I am 20 now and this lump has me stumped. I plan on asking my family practitioner about it the next time I go to the there but in the meantime I was wondering what it could possibly be? If anyone has any ideas that would be greatly appreciated. Obviously many years has passed and I ve ignored it so far. It seems though that it is getting bigger than it used to be and now I am starting to worry.

I see old pictures of myself and my eyes now definitely look closer together than they are then. I don't see any one my age (14) with close set eyes. Neither of my parents have close set eyes, nor do their parents. I am very upset and confused. I feel I would be a lot more confident and better looking with wider set eyes. It makes me so sad and insecure. Please help me. Why do I have this? Do I have some type of disease? After I finish puberty will they become normal width apart?

I used my older ones for maybe four weeks before (dancing two times a week in them, but the past week everyday for about an hour) and they feel a bit unstable when i go on pointe now. I can't tell if its just because I'm used to my extremely hard other shoes or if they are dead. I also feel like i can punch over my shoe but I'm not totally sure.

TITLE:  Driving from Paris to Normandy?
BODY: I will be visiting Paris in October, although I'll surely visit the Paris staples (e.g. The Eifel Tower, Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, etc) I'd really love to rent a car and drive to Normandy.  

My questions:
Is it difficult to drive from Paris to Normandy?

How is the drive? Is it scenic?

What is a good starting point (in Paris? Just outside of Paris) and what is a good final destination (Caen, Cherbourg, Bayeux, etc.)?

I would really enjoy seeing the D-Day beaches, as I am a history buff and have read quite a bit about the Normandy Landings.

Merci!

TITLE:  Do you think 2k needs to work on these things for 2k16?
BODY: 1) Missing wide-open lay-ups
2) Zig-Zag cheese
3) Baseline cheese
4) Lack of team ball (Harden 35 while the rest of the team only has 2 and still win.)
5) Have maximum 3 pt rating and still can't hit OPEN 3's
6) Playing park against the monstars every game
7) Playing myteam where pg position disappeares cause of LeBron at Pg (Don't say he dribbles the ball up, etc... Melo dribbles the ball up, he isn't a point guard.)
8) Pink diamond cheese (Most overpowered players given by codes Not by earning them and they did a diamond Pippen tournament in 2k14 to earn him so there are better ways.)
9) Lack of MT earning
10) SERVERS SUCK
11) Double team cheese
12) Mycareer teammates always suck (Can't hit wide open shots and pathetic defenders)
13) Gotta be an 80 or higher to start winning.
14) GM making bonehead decisions (I played for the Mavs and they traded all of my shooters for generic created players)
15) Injuries (Ellis out for the whole season for a wide open jumpshot.)
16) Storyline stinks
17) Overpowered opposition (Have to have stats like this: 55 pts 12 reb 19 ast 5 stl and 4 blks to barely beat the Charlotte Hornets)
18) Lack of purpose for euroleague teams 
19) Myteam never improves players value. 
20) Face-scan is torture to do 
21) Worthless players in myteam 
22) Some classic teams are missing key players 

There are other problems but those stood out to me. Not that 2k is a bad game but this was the worst 2k I ever played and I feel they're lazy and never will fix this.

TITLE:  Is it normal for my tooth to still hurt?
BODY: Okay, so maybe I'm jumping the gun but on the 7th of July I had two cavities filled close together on the left side of my jaw, I expected it to hurt but after a week it still hurt very badly. I went back to the dentist on Wednesday and he said I had a 'high bite' here's what it feels like. It's sensitive to both hot and cold and I can barely eat on that side, when I close my mouth it doesn't hurt, just when I eat but after I eat it throbs constantly for several hours until I take extra strength Tylenol, I don't want to overdose by taking so many pain killers, and I don't want to over react but at the same time I don't want to wait and it become a bigger problem, so please, is this normal? Should I see the dentist again? Any answers are appreciated!

TITLE:  DESPERATE NEED OF HELP How does pen vk work?
BODY: Started on a z-pak last week from a viral infection. Started on penicillin this week for oral bacterial infection. Due to various health issues I take a host of medication. However about an hr after taking the pen v my symptoms would actually worsen. From my eye down to my shoulder would tighten up really bad and the swelling would worsen. Is it normal for that to happen? And if feels like it's not helping and I'm 4 days in? I really need dental work but this has to work first. Is there anything else if this isn't the answer?

MLB popularity has been decreasing, obviously they need to shorten games, but as far as playoffs, i think every year SOOOOOO many deserving teams don't make the playoffs because there isn't enough spots, the 1 game wild card is stupid, having 8 teams going to 7 games, to me is much more exciting and would allow teams who deserve to be in the playoffs to make it, what do you think??

BODY: so i was petting my cat, but then I felt a weird lump on him. it was right on his ribcage. i kept touching it and figured out that it wasn't on his skin, like a tick or a flea but actually under his skin. he has black fur so I can't see anything if it IS actually on his skin. if a squeeze together the bit of skin with the lump and another, i can feel it under his skin. i squeezed it gently and he didn't react, so it probably isn't painful. i haven't taken him to the vet because I don't want to pay money if its just normal, can someone please help??

TITLE:  Sore throat after root canal and infected tooth?
BODY: About three weeks ago I had a very sore throat. It became quite red and inflamed. I had lots of mucus and post nasal drip, eventually lost my voice completely, and my earls also felt very blocked. No fever, no swollen glands, no real flu like symptoms, just a kind of cold. My doctor put me on Z Pac antibiotics, and I got better within a week (still had a lingering cough though). About two weeks after that, I began to experience a terrible pain on the roof of my mouth, and found that it was actually quite swollen. Went to the dentist who scheduled me for an emergency root canal (even though I felt no pain in the tooth itself). As soon as he opened it up, he told me there was a lot of decay in the tooth and nerve area, and that I also had an abscess and infection that was leaking pus into my bone. I have since been put on another antibiotic for that infection, and am set to have part II of my root canal this Monday. Since I had the first part done, I have noticed that the pain and swelling on the roof of my mouth has almost completely gone away, but I have started to have a bit of a sore throat again (mainly on the side of the mouth where I had the root canal and infection). I am wondering if this is normal, and if it is possible the two are related. I am also wondering if the sore throat/cold type illness that I had before all this began may have also been connected and possibly some kind of precursor. I will talk to my dentist more about this when I see him Monday.

BODY: Yeah so I had my hair black for about a year, and decided I wanted it my natural color. Which is like dark ash blondish. So I let it grow a bit, cut the dead off and bought a color stripper. But when I used it it only stripped like 2-3 inches away from my roots. So I still have quite a bit of black ends. I don't know wether to strip it again. Or just dye it back. Has anyone had this problem. Going to the salon is not an option for me so yeah that out of the picture. Just if anyone can help id really appreciate it. Thanks.

TITLE:  What are the pros and cons of getting a baby res?
BODY: So I'm thinking about getting a baby red eared slider and I've been doing research on it but none of the stuff I've found has told me if there are any draw backs of getting a baby and/or any good sides of it I already own one so I know I can take care of an adult but is a baby a lot different then an adult (I know they need more meat when they are young) I would be keeping the baby in a different tank then the one I have my adult in 
Also how fast would a male baby res grow per a month or year?

TITLE:  I'm scared to do fouettes?
BODY: I was learning how to do fouettes in dance a while back and I could do them. Then the teacher left the room quickly and I started doing them un  supervised, I fell out of my fouetté and rolled my ankle so badly I couldn't even walk on it I was in so much pain and I started crying. Every time I've attempted to do them again I keep twisting it. I went to the doctor and they said it's just a sprain. Recently I went to the hospital and they said I need a MRI scan because it could be a fracture or a chip and I could also torn ligaments. I'm resting my foot until I go for the MRI scan but when I'm better I'm terrified to do them again. Are there any tips on how to get over my fear or and strengthening tips??

TITLE:  How do I remove game files from my desktop without making the game stop running?
BODY: I installed a game almost a year ago called Smite, but besides the shortcut to open the game a bunch of other files from the game appeared in my desktop. I didn't care much because it only used up about half my desktop, but today I turned on my computer to play and the other half of my desktop was filled with more game files. I tried putting all of them into a folder, but when I do the game doesn't run. It says it cannot open because "x" file is missing. I'd like to move them out of my desktop, and the game to still be able to run. If anyone knows please help.

TITLE:  Tattoo Help?
BODY: So, I am a 12 (almost 13) year old female. I have a decently low pain tolerance, and an okay stomach. I have been thinking a lot recently about my state's laws for tattoos, and I learned you can get one at any age with parental consent. My mom is all for tattoos, and she would probably support me getting one. 

I want just a small, black cross on the inside of my wrist (like the picture, but centered.) because even in the darkest of times my faith has stayed with me. 

I've heard so much about wrist tattoos.  I don't know what to believe! I've heard that they don't hurt, that they do hurt.. How much would it hurt based on my description of myself?

TITLE:  Is a temperature between 70-73 uncomfortable for a cat since they like much warmer temperatures?
BODY: Jane is my first cat in 15 years (I was only around 4 when I had my 3 others but we had to give them up) and I'm concerned that the temperature may be too cold for her. She's roughly a year and a half old and during the day in South Carolina the temperature is averaging somewhere between 90-99 and Jane has been sleeping on the tile floor to keep cool while at night the temperature drops to around 80-88. During the day she cuddles up next to me and naps while she stretches out her body and she'll sleep like that for hours and at night like tonight, she'll cuddle next to me and lie outstretched like she does when she naps because she's too warm. But when she hops to sleep somewhere where she's alone she curls up a little like she's too cold. My room gets unusually hot (very close to the temperature outside) so I have to keep fans on or turn on the air conditioner which I used to keep cold(65 because that's how cold I like to be at night) but since I got Jane I'm trying to keep it at room temperature or just a little below but I'm not sure if she's comfortable because she alternates from the cool floor to the warmth of my bed or even the couch.

TITLE:  Braces, palatal expander, herbst...?
BODY: I'm getting those soon. My upper arch is shaped like a v and not a u. Correcting this with expander. Because my arch is a v shape, that has caused crowding on my upper teeth. Correcting that with braces. I have a pretty big overbite, so I'm getting a herbst for that. After the herbst, I'm getting rubber bands.

Is there anything I should know about:
Braces
Herbst appliance
Expander
Rubber bands
Spacers

Even the smallest of details help. 

If I have to have crowns for the appliances, do I have to get spacers? 
Will I be able to play my flute with the herbst? It's really the only thing I'm good at. 
I'm 13 and have already hit my growth spurt and got my period (they said my period was relevant in some way). Would I have to get jaw surgery or would my mouth still be flexible enough not to?

Thank you all in advance

I have been reading online and people be saying 'think twice before you use your tv as a monitor and stuff like that'. I don't understand why ? All I am asking is that if reduces the lifespan or cause any problem or destroys the TV or anything like that ? I personally don't see no problem in that.

TITLE:  Should I get the Brazilian Keratin Straightening or the Japanese Straightening (very curly hair)?
BODY: So here s my situation:
I have really curly, dry, frizzy hair (3b-3c type if you know what I mean) and I hate it  and want to get it straightened. Note: this isn t my first rodeo. I had been getting the Japanese Straightening like twice a year for about 4 years because I wanted it completely straight and that s what was recommended to me. However, while I was blissfully happy for the first two months after each treatment, it started taking a nasty toll on my hair (it would get dried out, brittle, etc) and after four years of doing it I stopped, and over a year after my last treatment my hair looked awful (besides the fact that my natural hair had grown out, the straight part was in awful shape.) (And after that I practically shaved my head, partially because of the damage caused.)
My hair is now much shorter than it was a few years ago (it was like 16-18 inches long, now about 8 inches.) I think I want to grow it out to its old length too. But I definitely want to straighten/relax it because it is way too curly and frizzy and needlessly difficult to manage. Given my situation, should I go with the Brazilian Keratin Straightening or should I go back to the Japanese Straightening? My concern with the Brazilian Straightening is that it won t leave my hair straight enough because I have 3b-3c type hair and I do want it straight or highly relaxed. But is there a way to prevent the damage with the Japanese Straightening if I follow certain guidelines?

TITLE:  My cats literally wanna kill each other. HELP!?
BODY: Alright so I recently got seperated. I moved from a big 3 bedroom apartment to a small bachelor, with my two cats. The male is 3 years old and the female is a year old. They have always loved each other. They used to sleep cuddled up all the time, he would clean her and she would clean him. I moved out about 2 months ago and they were fine. But now, they absolutely hate each other. They constantly fight and make the strangest noises ever. The male is twice the size of the small one so I'm afraid he'll hurt her. I have to break out fights constantly. He pins her down and bites her super hard. I'm moving into a two bedroom apartment with a friend in a month and a half, will they get back to their normal loving self? For now, I've seperated them the best I can, considering I'm in a bachelor. I'm not sure what to do and I really don't wanna give one away. They're my babies. Help :(

BODY: I opened dxdiag on my laptop only to find out that my display runs on my intel hd 5500 graphics instead of my NVidia 940M GPU. My video quality sucks as the integrated graphics work as my display adapter instead I want the GPU to work as my display adapter. My GPU is shown in the render section of dxdiag application. Is there any way to make my GPU the main display adapter ?
PS I uninstalled the intel hd graphics software but it did not work as the main display adapter changed to Microsoft basic display or something like that.
Please Help !!!!!!!!

TITLE:  I WANT TO CUT MY HAIR INTO A PIXIE?
BODY: okay so I have an oval face and my cheekbones show ALOT especially when I'm smiling or really happy. People love them. I heard that pixie cuts bring out your features. I can NEVER see myself with long hair (whenever it gets long, I always grab a pair of scissors and chop it off). For the past year, my hair has been only to my shoulders. Anyway, I want to cut it like shailene woodley's. however, I am a sophmore in highschool and I don't want to do such a dramatic look. I was kind of hoping to grow it out by senior year and then after graduation, I donate it. Should I do it ? I've always wanted to cut it since I was little. :D

TITLE:  Is the American Library of Poetry really a scam?
BODY: I submitted a poem for one of the American Library of Poetry s contest a few years ago while I was in high school. Recently, I was notified that I had been chosen as a winner but never notified; now, they would like to publish my poem in their upcoming 2015 collections book "Eloquence".

After my initial excitement I googled the ALoP out of curiosity and also because I am much older now and a bit dubious after years have gone by. 

The website doesn t look very professional and I remember it being a different layout before. However, I don t have to pay anything to be published...
They don t have any public books apparently, so does this mean being published would be worthless?

Does the book really include every submission they receive?
I am not sure if I should submit the publication consent form or not.

TITLE:  Hair dye and developer question!!?
BODY: For years I've had bright red hair using L'oreal reds for dark hair only. But only now did i actually let it all come out in the shower/pool leaving my hair a weird blonde redish with about an inch and a half of my natural dark brown hair growing. With my hair already blonde, but my roots. I really want to continue using the hair dye I've used for years and I love the color but what number developer should I use with my hair practically stripped of color? I believe i normally use a 30 but i think that might be too much for my hair at this moment since my hair feel weird wet because there is no color. Please let me know ❤

BODY: My hair is a strawberry blonde/ ginger colour and I really want to dip dye it.
Its this sort of colour: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/138907969734080174/
 Im 14 years old and my school says we can dye our hair any colour, as long as we don't start a trend.
I'm not sure what colour though

I really like this: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/397301998348292302/

But I think I might prefer a brighter/ more out there colour.

What to do you think?
What colour would go best? Its also wavy and fairly long.
I've grown it to the length it is now, and decided to dye it so that if I don't like it and cut it off then it would still be pretty long!

It's true that I don't put up cream, so could that be the reason? anyways I wish to hear some tips and if possible permanent solutions.

BODY: I've had a strain in my shoulder like a month ago and decided to rest for a whole month. I went back to the gym knowing that I would be ok to lift again. I put less weight so my shoulder gets use to lifting again but it sometimes just starts hurting. I'm able to do 2 sets of 10 but in my 3rd set it starts hurting. Does this mean I need to rest more or is it normal? What should I do?

I know someone giving away a free 10 gallon tank. Would that be ok for them to live happily?  Or should I start with something bigger?  I was looking at getting three but I know they grow and I don't want to crowd them.

TITLE:  Chipped tooth ruining my life?
BODY: So many bad luck things happened to easily been avoided plus my negativity made it worse whixh led me to get out of bed one night stress on and biting fibger naiks really hard. Of course I had to not stay in bed and and chipped the back side of my bottom front tooth biting nails which wasnt noticeable but the chunk it took off baxk made rip pretty thin. I did get the.chipped area dental bonded. But its been 4 months and I have been suicidal over it and even stayed at mental hospital twice. It bothers me so much, the weak material, the fakeness of it, the weakened thinned tooth, it just makes me feel weak and I fear the future for it like how long bonding will last for and what my tooth will look like under it. I spend every minute even at work thinking about it and I just gained confidence in life (am 23) never has girlfriend but just got really muscular and good at my martial arts training I go to but now I lost all confidence and am getting a little fat. My performance at work is suxking and its killing me.that this is causing this. But I do feel thus chippedntooth is limiting me and holding back my potential physically. I mean one thing that's sure is that it physically weakened my tooth who knows no id be able to eat with it without it breaking off.the tip if didn't get bonded. I almost want to get bonsing off and leave chip naked but dont know how fragile tooth would be.I want to be like a tiger but a tiger without tooth will struggle to survive in the wild

TITLE:  Wrist tattoos?
BODY: Hi there! I've always thought small, classy wrist tattoos look beautiful....and so I've always kinda wanted one. If I did get one, it'd be the golden flower from Disney's Tangled. Disney has always meant so much to me, and Tangled is one of my favorite movies. I look and act pretty similar to Rapunzel and I'm still wondering when my life will begin. (hehe) Anyway, the tattoo choice wouldn't be something I regret. However, do inner wrist tattoos look bad once your skin is wrinkled? Also, I'm worried about the pain level...I'd like to think I'm tough, but who knows.

BODY: Hello, my uncle  recently built me birdhouses that measure 5 inches by 6 inches. my questions are:

1.what size birds on long island may i eventually find living in the nesting box.

2.is it safe to place nesting boxes in trees? the opening hole is 1 1/2 inches but i'm scared squirrels may get in and eat the eggs. is there a way to prevent this?

3. how to have a greater chance of birds living in the house? and is now too late in the season for birds to move in? Thank you.

I then received the bill for te operation but they didn't cover his surgical costs. They covered everything else including the surgical room costs.  I am a first year teacher and college loan repayer.   Need help and ideas how I can get them to cover

BODY: Neighbors recently started playing horse- shoes in their narrow backyard. The people who are renting the house sent a visitor over to apologize and ask for their horse-shoe that it had come over the fence. When I go outside I find the horse-shoe about 3 feet into my yard and the top of my 6 ft tall fence is shattered again the visitor apologize and say it hit the stake and bounced into the air and thay will fix it which I doubt.  Not knowing much about the game, can horse-shoes bounce 6 ft or is it reckless throwing. Im concerned if it can happen again and  for my family and pets.

TITLE:  Filtered tank hurt my betta fish. We put my male betta in a gallon filtered tank and left him in it over night. The next morning he is sick.?
BODY: We have a blue, male, veil tail betta fish who was very strong, lively and had a temper. We kept him in an unfiltered tank, which we kept changed, chlorinated, and at the right temp. and he loved it. He blew awesome bubble nests and flared on command and even performed some tricks. We moved him to a gallon filtered tank because he was our pride and joy. We left him in it over night and the next morning, he has severe equilibrium problems (so we think). He often floats on his side and upside down, he can t swim to the bottom of the water because he floats back to the surface. His bladder looks puffed up but we do not over feed him (2-3 pellets a day &amp; the occasional bloodworm). We removed him from the filtered tank and put him in his old unfiltered one hoping he will not die because he is in bad condition. He just looks exhausted, we think the current was too strong for him and beat him up.  Anything we can do to save his life??

TITLE:  Safe to power through elbow pain with icing in between sets?
BODY: I've had what my doctor thinks is tennis elbow for about a year.  So I stopped working out and weightlifting all together for a year to let my elbow heal.  Every month it hurts slightly less and less, but it still hurts a tiny bit when I fully extend my arm.  A year of rest seemed good enough, so I decided to start doing some push ups and light dumbbell curls again.  I prepared a bowl of ice water and tried icing my elbow between sets for 30 seconds and then continued working out.  It worked pretty well.  I didn't feel any pain at all and was able to work out for 10 or 15 minutes.  So my question is, 

Is this safe to do?

Going to the Doctor every time I have a new question can get expensive, so that's why I'm asking here.  Does anyone have any experience with this?

I'm thinking that the elbow still hurts because it's weak from a year of no exercise.  So working out again may be like rehabilitation.  It hurts, but it's a good pain or could I be just making things worse?

Thanks for reading!

And by the way, I suspect that I don't have classic tennis elbow.  I have no forearm pain at all.  The pain is concentrated in only the joint itself.  From what I read, that doesn't sound like tennis elbow.

BODY: They have a track record of outperforming but now at this size, can they really continue to outperform?  the law of large numbers says size reduces outperformance.........

I mean this isn't just a large cap, this is a freakin MEGACAP. 
This is a MATURE company.

but hey, Apple is nearly twice the size of Google and somehow Apple has been continuing to outperform the S &amp; P 500.

maybe Google is one of those magical companies like Berkshire Hathaway that will continue to outperform the S&amp;P500 regardless of its size.


still, I think money could be put to better use in say, PayPal.  That's a high-quality internet name, still growing, that's about 1/10th the size of Google.

TITLE:  6 year old brother overweight, parents are enablers?
BODY: My brother weighs 90 pounds and is supposed to be about fifty pounds. He wheezes while eating. He can go through boxes of corndogs &amp; cereal in 1 day, on top of other food. When he tries to get extra food &amp; is stopped, he will cry,throw a tantrum, and physically attack me. Putting food high up doesn t work,he just climbs the cabinets or pulls a chair to get to them.

My parents arent of any help. They continue to buy junk food and let him eat whatever. One day when I was cooking breakfast, my brother came to me for a plate. He had already ate a large bowl of lucky charms so I told him no. My mom, angrily and out of spite to me I guess, fixed him a large plate and snapped to me that she knows how to raise her kids.

Hes already getting bullied in first grade and thankfully it doesnt really affect him now,but I know as he and classmates get older itll get worse.

What can I do?

But I'm a little hesitant, too. I've never used anything beynod their facial cleansers, which really do work better than other for me, so I don't know how well the hair product line would do, to be honest. 
I'm using Aveeno now, but my hair's drying out and becoming coarse faster from it...

TITLE:  Fancy goldfish setup?
BODY: My cousin has 3 goldfish in a 10 gallon aquarium *shudder* There's one oranda, a ryukin, and a common goldfish. Of course, the tank is horribly overstocked, and just thinking about the tank makes me cringe. The substrate is gravel, and it's small enough that you can tell the oranda would easily be able to fit some gravel in it's mouth. It has a heater, and it's ALWAYS AT 78F. The filter is pretty small, and the tank is overstocked. I was thinking about rescuing at least the fancy goldfish, and if I still have room the common goldfish. She lives a while away, and I was thinking about trading her some of my fancy guppies for the goldfish once I get their tanks cycled. So here's my plan- get two 55 gallon stock tanks/tubs (maybe 3) I keep the oranda and ryukin together, and keep the common goldfish in a separate 55 tub (until it gets bigger). Both of the tubs will have a filter rated for 75 gallons and have a sand substrate and java ferns in them. (I'm going to cycle both tanks first, of course) I'm thinking about putting the common outside and getting he/she a buddy once I upgrade it's tank. I'm going to feed all of the goldfish Solient Green and have a lid for both of the stock tanks. Does this all sound good?

TITLE:  Do other basketball referees out there recommend wearing an undershirt under a basketball referee shirt?
BODY: I have asked several other questions regarding being a basketball referee this next season, and I am trying to get help regarding some equipment/attire. My uniform starter package includes two referee shirts, pants, socks, and shoes; but does not come with any undershirt. I typically wear an undershirt with shirts unless I am wearing casual T-shirt. I know the activity of officiating a game does cause one to get hot and sweaty. Would I get too hot, or would an undershirt help keep my referee shirt dry? What do you other referees do and recommend? Any specific type/brand? If you are not a current or former referee, please do not answer.

My mom said I can buy

*mascara
Any good brands for them? 
Thank you.

TITLE:  Why won't my fishtank water clear?
BODY: I have a 20 gallon tank and the water is cloudy you can see through it in the front but it's a little cloudy and if you were to look through the side you cannot see through it I have done 3 water changes two days ago I did about a 30% the next day I did about a 30% again and it was still cloudy so I bought some chemicals that would clear the water and added it and did another water change like the directions said but the cloudiness is still the same and today I did a 50% water change and it has cleared up but very little. The tank isn't new and I have a filter for a 30 gallon on it

I have been using cross browser for a long time and I like it a lot no ads no nothing . But recently I gave my laptop to a professional to get rid of some viruses I had on it. The next day I went to take my acer back and the man told me that the anti virus system he used actually deleted the cross browser I have been using. I forgot how and from where to reinstall it. Should I or should I not. And if I shouldn't what should I install?😅

TITLE:  How sturdy are the mesh tops on glass tanks?
BODY: My cat is about 7-8 pounds and she jumps on top of my hamster cage with one of those wire mesh covers. 
I'm afraid one day while I'm at school, she'll either eventually bust it or figure out how to take the top off!
I've disciplined her numerous times when she was smaller and she quit, now she's back at it and now she's older so she won't follow my orders. So I just let her lounge up there while I'm in the room.

TITLE:  How do i get rid of 14 cats?
BODY: I recently had alot of mice in my house and i dont trust traps and the mice were literally eating my house so i took my dads van and drove deep into the neighborhood at night and picked up 8 cats and brought them home and they ate all of the mice but that very day 2 of them got pregnant and they littered 3 kittens each. I sent the rest of the cats back in the wild and i kept the 2 mothers and 6 kittens for about a month. Theyre still not yet grown. Then the mothers i believe were raped by 3 other cats who had been hiding in my house since then. I took those cats to the pound. Then the mothers littered. 1 littered 2 cats and 1 littered 3. So now i has 12 cats to take care of. So then one of the mothers was "whoring out" another cat so she could ******* litter again so i locked her out the house for the night. The next morning i saw her lying in the middle of the street with blood on her arms.  So i took her to the aspca and they gave me a cash reward for saving an injured animal. So now i have 11 cats remaining so how do i get rid of them? Most of them are so young i cant leave them all outside

TITLE:  Why did Europeans falsely painted all Africans as spear poking, naked savages?
BODY: I've been studying a lot of African history and medieval Africa was not much different from Europe.They  different paces had different levels of civilization and advancements. Sure some were primitve, but others had well organised political systems engaged in trade and academic ventures.The same way not all places in Europe were civilized and some tribes/places were better of than others.There were great empires like the Benin empire, shongai empire,Malian empire etc, history call battles and events, important trade routes, interesting political power plays,power full figures etc. One of the places i'd like to mention is the Malian Empire. Before the European Renaissance, Timbuktu,one of it's s cites flourished as the greatest academic and commercial center in Africa.The University of Timbuktu produced both Black African scholars and leaders of the highest rank, character and nobility. Around the 12th century, the University of Timbuktu had an attendance of 25,000 students in a city which had a population of over 100,000 people.The manuscripts of Timbuktu which were discovered and are now being preserved cover diverse subjects such as mathematics,chemistry,physics,optics,astronomy,astrology,history,geography,government legislation and treaties, jurisprudence and much more.Mansa Musa who ruled Mali at it s height of greatness has been announced as the richest man in history.He had a personal net worth of $400billion at the time of his death in 1331.

TITLE:  Baby guinea pig not eating much?
BODY: Ive a almost 4 week old guinea pig and she doesn't seem to be eating much, I doubt she is sick because I took her to a vet one of the first few days I had her and I've had her for a week and the vet said she's fine and just gave her shot because she had some fleas (my fault) but she's eating very little and I think it's my older guinea pigs fault because anytime she tries to eat my older pig pecks at her? (Idrk it looks like biting) so is it because my older pig is bullying her? If so what should I do? If not, is thid normal in baby pigs? I'm very worried :( please help

TITLE:  Help, cat is excessively licking herself bold.?
BODY: My cat who is about 4 now has started excessively licking herself to the point of having bald spots on the base of her tail belly and on inside spots of her legs. the skin looks healthy no irritation or wounds just the thinning to lose of fur. fur is growing back in certain spots. i thought it may be stress as i am packing to move again but she has moved with me before and has never done this. the house i live in now is a bit warmer than where ive lived before so i also wondered if maybe it was her licking to keep cool and it just being a side effect. shes shown know difference in behavior, still actively plays eats regularly. i dont know what to do for her or what could cause this. the nearest trustworthy vet is 2 hours away.

I know there's an option in Windows to reinstall the os but I think it only reinstalls the system on the drive it's already on &amp; doesn't give you an option to install somewhere else. Should I just clone my HD to the SSD, put the SSD in the computer then reinstall Windows again?

TITLE:  Makeup Artist advice?
BODY: I want to become a makeup artist, I want to become really good at it, I want to work in big cities, I want to make this a career &amp; an every day part of my life (and for all you negative people out there, yall can kiss my ***, I don't care if this sounds far fetched, it's something I WANT to do, and maybe I won't make it, but maybe I will because I want it &amp; I'm going to go for it.) Anyways, I want this really bad &amp; am ready to do what I need to do to get there. I'm still very young (19) &amp; have a long road ahead of me, also because I'm not very experienced in makeup itself, let alone business, clientele etc. So I would appreciate some advise on what to do, but I'm mainly looking for websites, books, etc for the best on becoming a makeup artist, such as how to do makeup, certain looks, and so on. If you have any other side comments or suggestions (nothing negative) please put them in the answer box!! Thank you! :)

TITLE:  Broke 2 4ft long black lights in room am I ok?
BODY: Last night while moving my tv I pull the cords to both my 4' blacklight tubes and they fell and shattered there was white powder everywhere and glass I cleaned it up with a broom and went to sleep, this morning I had a hard time waking up and feel kind if sick and out of it, I told my brother about the accident and he told me about the mercury poisoning. I'm freaking out now as I didn't know about it. Will I be ok and is there anything I should do to make sure I'm ok?

Thanks

BODY: I'm going to bleach my hair but I want to do it professionally at the salon and I want to know how much it will cost in NYC. Also if you know any cheap place in Brooklyn but still good quality. I have faded purpleish hair and its medium length and semi-thick in my opinion so if you know a place that would be very helpful thanks. :)

TITLE:  How to treat a cut?
BODY: I got a pretty nasty cut on my middle finger, was being stupid with a large pocket knife and got myself pretty good, finally stopped the bleeding m (had to throw away a blood covered towel) and cleaned it, I have it bandaged and have antibiotic on it. I want this to heal quickly because it's very inconvenient. So - how often should I re-apply the antibiotic (mupirocin) and bandaid, I was told to let it get some air but upon research it turns out that doesn't help. Any tips on how to take care of it and get it to heal as quickly as possible are appreciated

So a few nights ago, I was using my computer but I put my speaker s aux cord into a USB port on my ASUS Flipbook (i3) and it caused my computer to crash and not turn on. I fried it. It has a shortage and I hear that due to it s short, I could have damaged its motherboard. There s tons of important things on my computer and I sent it back to ASUS already but I want a quick answer. Is all of my stuff going to be there still? There s tons of important things on there. I had auto backup on by the way.

TITLE:  Should I shave my facial hair? Can I also shave my hands?
BODY: I am almost 13, and I am already noticing that I have darker facial hair on my upper lip.  I have heard that shaving does not cause hair to grow back darker and thicker.  I have also heard that it does.  A couple of years ago I shaved my legs and arms to see what it was like even though my hair was not dark.  Now my hair is dark and on my arms is long and thick.  My arms are still light colored, but the hair  is thicker and longer than my friends, so I don't know if it's genetics or if it's because I shaved.  
Also, for my hands I was noticing a bit more hair that i wanted and so I tried shaving them.  they felt so silky and soft afterwards!  Now my hair is darker and I am seeing a bit more than i did before!!  If I continue to shave, do you think it will be worse?  
I would also like to know if I could possibly wax? By the way I am a girl.

TITLE:  A couple of questions about my RES turtles?
BODY: I have two RES turtles and they are coming up on their year birthday, one this month and the other in September. I have a few questions, I remember reading the answers to them a year ago when I first started doing research on them but for some reason can't re-find the information. 

How quickly should they be growing (I know each turtle is different but on average so I can make sure they aren't growing too quickly)? They are 3.3 and 3.2 inches right now. Is this a good size for being almost a year old? And next year should I expect about the same amount of growth or should it be decreasing a little? 

Also, their heater is still set to 80 degrees because I know hatchlings need warmer water than adults. Are they still at the size where 80 is good or should I lower it? They seem to enjoy the warm water though. They always lay on the heater as if they like how it's slightly warmer right on top of it. 

Lastly, I am still feeding them mostly meat and commercial pellets. At what age/size will they start enjoying vegetables? I hand feed them and if I try feeding them lettuce they won't eat it but one time I left lettuce in their tank and I assume they ate it because it slowly disappeared (or it just got stuck underneath the rocks in their tank). 

I know how to take care of my turtles so please don't leave a bunch of information on things I didn't ask for. I know a lot of these answers are different for each turtle but I'd like on average. Thank you!

TITLE:  What is wrong with my eyes?
BODY: For the last 2 months i've had an uncomfortable feeling in my eyes.

It started with my left eye and my right eye came in a few weeks later,

The feeling is I feel sometimes like there are air bubbles in my eyes and when I press the corner of each eye a small popping happens and then the feeling goes away for a couple minutes

When im tired its hard to focus on objects but I dont lose my sight at all

There are no floaters in my eyes

I dont see light flashes

Sometimes the feeling goes away for a day and comes back

Yesterday I sneezed really really hard and the pain in my nose and eyes went away and I felt so great and then it came back about 8 hours later.

I also have a headache with my eye feelings but its so minor that I barely feel it, it feels like a hat is on a little too tight.

ive used systane gel and it made my eyes feel much better as far as the dry eye feeling I had but there still feels like there is pressure in my eye and head that cant escape 


I've been to the hospital twice and eye doctor and all 3 times say im fine may be allergies but I know what allergies feel like in my eyes, they don't itch at all. I dont want to be that person that doctors told there was nothing wrong but they missed something, because I see that often.
Please help me, I dont want to go blind

TITLE:  Yet another Runner's Knee question...?
BODY: I am a fairly physically fit 25 y/o man, 'weight lifting' fit haha. I recently started preparing for my upcoming basic training ship date which consists of a lot of running, pushups, &amp; situps. Not exactly what I'm used to! The first few weeks were ok, no unconfortable pain in my runs, until one day my knees and my hips started to ache to the point of me barely being able to walk for several days. That was a month and a half ago ago... Since then i bought arch support insoles (i discovered that i have flat feet), a few knee braces (which allow me to run with very little pain), and a few compression sleeves. I have been icing and compressing my knees several times a day lately and havent been to the track for over a week after reading somewhere that I shouldn't run with knee braces (is this correct btw?). Instead i use the spin bikes at my local gym and do seated leg presses in hopes of strengthening my leg muscles for running.

My right knee healed fairly well about a week ago but my left knee is still hurting to the point of not allowing me to jump in place without bad pain. 

Should i add something to my training? What should i do to cure my runners knee? Thanks!

TITLE:  How can I get a medi-cal card in California?
BODY: I have a Santa Clara family health plan card, called the dentist I usually go to and they told me since I missed the last appointment and since they're no longer accepting new clients I can't make one there. I then checked my card and called my primary care provider, who sent me to the nurse advice hotline, who then sent me to member services. Member services told me I need to order a medi-cal card to make a dentist appointment. 

I'm currently homeless and 18, staying at a young adult shelter. Didn't finish high school, being homeless made it difficult to keep going, and am waiting to get into job corps so then I can join the marine corps or the navy. Completely stressed out right now and have no clue what I should be doing.

also, dentist appointment is urgent, got a cavity and don't want it to turn into a root canal.

(Idrk it looks like biting) so is it because my older pig is bullying her? If so what should I do? If not, is this normal in baby pigs? I'm very worried :( please help

TITLE:  Does anyone know of ballet classes for adults in London in which one could make progress(i.e.receive corrections and decent instruction)?
BODY: I would prefer open classes if possible as my schedule can be erratic (although I'm aware this is not ideal for receiving individual correction).

I have read up a lot on here about what makes a good or at least safe environment in which to learn ballet, and I can't find any places in north London which offer this :( I tried a few local places with small classes and individual attention, but they were a) taught on concrete floors, b) the teachers taught Pointe even if you only went once weekly, c) the technique taught was not only bad but downright dangerous (i.e. I was told to lock back my hyperextended knees, force turnout from the knees, no mention of basics like doming feet/pulling up core etc). I then tried open classes - the ones in Pineapple and Danceworks were safe (i.e. sprung floors etc), but so crowded I could hardly move, and no correction whatsoever - just exercise after exercise. I then tried an open class at Central School of Ballet (thinking that it is a reputable ballet academy and hence it couldn't be too bad), and although it was small with decent corrections, the teacher told me to practice Pointe at home on my own to get used to it despite never having done any Pointe work at all, and hence I'm starting to doubt whether she really knew what she was doing! 
It's so frustrating :(

Does anyone know of any classes in London which might offer safe, quality instruction with some individual correction? Unfortunately I can't make the RAD HQ. Thank you :)

TITLE:  Hurt my ankle...?
BODY: Hi so basically it's been almost 3 weeks ago now but we were playing rounders at school and we were on our last inning so I just went for a rounder (I did get it) and I slipped in mud at 4th base. My left foot went completely on to its side and it hurt the outside of my foot A LOT! I didn't feel anything break/rip inside but I've been in a lot of pain ever since.

I've had a limp since that day, it's been really sensitive, really hard to walk on and really painful to touch. It didn't/hasn't swollen up much.

I think I have made it worse as I have not rest since the injury as we went on a trip to Paris with school and there was A LOT of walking. It sounds really silly but the other day I stepped on a really small stone which was on the path and it hurt my foot tremendously... This is 3 weeks after the initial incident...

I just wondered if anyone knows what I might have done to the outside of the foot, what I need to do (go to doctors/hospital for example) and what a doctor might do if he needs to intervene. 

Any answer is appreciated&lt;3

TITLE:  How to do my own hair without offending my hairstylist?
BODY: I've been doing my hair myself for the past 10 years and I'm really good at it. I went to cosmetology school so I know what I'm supposed to do and how to do it correctly, but decided to go to a family friends salon to have her do my hair for me.  I don't usually trust other hairdressers but I really love her technique and she does a great job!  My next appointment to lighten my hair won't be for another three weeks but I'm going out of town and really want to do my hair myself today. I feel like she'll be offended if I do it myself… Even though I'll be going to her for touch ups/cuts/and colors in the future!!

I don't want to offend her or make her think I don't appreciate her or like her work! My hair just faded into a really ugly orange color and I'm too antsy to wait until she wants to schedule me in!

What do I tell her???

TITLE:  Hair Highlights Emergency!
-Yellow tones
-Splotchy color?
BODY: So I dyed my hair at home, which was probably a bad idea. I was aiming for some ashy not too light highlights on the top layer of my hair, but I left the bleach in too long and now it is really yellow, and not even, there are spots where it looks splotchy and weird. (My natural hair is a dark brown by the way) Anyway I really don't like it, I don't even want to go anywhere in public, it's so bad. I am fine with going back to my original color, but will that be okay? Like if I get some dye of my natural color or darker, and just put it on all over, will it look weird on top of the yellow, or will it make it go away? and will it fix the splotches? If not what should I do???? 
Please help!

TITLE:  Is it possible to have a pinched nerve for three months?
BODY: My mom claims to have horrible hip pain from a pinched nerve. She's been complaining about this pinched nerve for over three months, and says it isn't getting better.

She's 46. I suspect that she's lying to me, trying to manipulate me into doing all the housework while she sleeps all day.

Is it possible to have a pinched nerve for three months? If so, how can she get better?

If it isn't possible, do you think she's lying or is something else wrong with her?

TITLE:  Did I nearly lose parts of my fingers?
BODY: So I wanted a beer (every good story starts like that). Had one next to me but it was warm. WASHED the can and put it like that in the FREEZER instead of the refrigerator to cool it down faster. Went back to take it some time later with my hands WET and once I grabbed it, it stuck to my hand. 

Quick what do I do? It started to sting like needles were going in my fingers. Mythbusters prepared me for this moment. Sink, turned the water on maximum with the other hand and washed the can stuck to my hand removing every finger very slowly. Used hot water on my fingers to prevent frostbite.

I think it still took too long because my fingers still hurt now about 15 minutes later and I have 2-3 very, very small blisters on the tips of my fingers. Do I need a doctor?

When I got home it was swollen around my bottom knuckle and it was red, I can bend it but my first knuckle I can not bend that much. It still hurts and I have to know what is wrong because if I see a doctor I'm scared I have to get a cast and I don't want that happening. I've put ice on it and it's been 3 days. It's not red anymore and it's barely puffy but but it still hurts.

TITLE:  What tattoo removal creams work?
BODY: Right lads I'm a dumass I got a drunk tattoo 2 weeks ago and I regret it its a tattoo of all 4 teenage mutant ninja turtles down my leg. It seemed like a great idea at the time but for obvious reasons you can see why I want it removed its not as big as it sounds it's about 3 inches but anyway do you know of any cream that will fade it or remove it fully and can I apply it straight away or should I wait for the tattoo to heal fully cheers

TITLE:  Why don't I get any likes on facebook?
BODY: I have 217 friends on Facebook I'm not popular in school because I'm from another country and people dislike me for no reason when I haven't done anything to them at all they hate me and bully me everyday at school. People tell me I should be a model but I doubt it because I never get any likes. Like for example a girl would get 250 likes for a weird selfie doing double chin and what not.

But I would only get about 19 likes for a decent photo with my friends :/ could it be that they hate me all 198? they also smoke and do other things but I'm more of a student than an easy going person I really want to achieve a lot of things and I'm ready to try and to never give up to achieve my goals.

Anyway, they are both male gerbils and they need names! One is black with a few white spots on his head and belly. The other one is brown. Like I said, they are both male and they need names. I kinda want matching names like Tom and Jerry(from the tv show), or something like that. Single names would be fine too. Whether its like Mocha and Bob, or Midnight and Shaodw.It doesnt really matter to me, I just want creative names. Thanks a bunch! :)

BODY: Hey, so a few days ago my Facebook randomly logged out on my phone. I'm still logged in on my laptop. I forgot my password because it's been 5 months since I've logged in and since I've changed it.

I think I was also hacked because my email was taken off. I've tried to reset my password but I can't because I don't have any emails or phone numbers connected to it anymore. Facebook won't let me do anything because of that.

I was wondering if there were any other ways to reset my password or if I can directly contact Facebook to get my account back and prove that it is me. Do I have to just get a new Facebook?

TITLE:  Are Limbal Rings _always_ black?
BODY: Since birth my eyes have been very dark (almost black) and have changed (barely) to a dark chocolate shade. My entire life I have not had black limbals, they're gold. My cornea, sclera, pupil, and overall eye health is in tip-top shape (No sodium, cholesterol, copper, or iron deposits at all. Nothing). So I am wondering is it "common" to have naturally different colored limbal rings? Does anyone else have them? Or is this some rare genetic disease and I'm actually dying oh God

BODY: I got him about five days ago. I was keeping an eye on his water level and it hasn't gone down. We got a new cage with a new bottle and he still hasn't touched it. I tried pushing on the ball in the new bottle and it seems hard to move. I cut up a cup and put water in to see if he'll take from that. I'm worried he'll die if he doesn't drink soon.
Note: He's a Chinese Dwarf Hamster, I don't know if his small size affects how much water he needs but I felt that I should add it

One follicle of my hair right now is about and inch in length, but it curls so much that my hair doesn't look to talk on my head. Anyhow, the problem is. My hair looks nappy so much. I can pick my hair out and it will look good for say 30 to 50 minutes then it's nappy again. Like wth??? It sucks because I have to carry a comb/pick with me everywhere I go., and continuously comb it. Anything I can do about this????

TITLE:  Problems with my new GPU?
BODY: I bought a new graphics card yesterday and installed it on my computer from around 2008. It is the Radeon R7 240.
I have 4 GB of ram and i'm running on Windows Vista.
Everything seemed to be functioning and working properly until I tried to install the drivers. Then I encountered the problem. My computer wasn't detecting the new GPU.
I tried going into the device manager but that didn't work because all it said in the display adapters was the Standard VGA Graphics Adapter, and not my new one. I also tried going into the BIOS in the startup, but there was nothing there about onboard and primary things. I tried getting the drivers manually on the website and that also did not recognize any hardware. 
I know it works because the fan is on and my monitor is connected.
I don't know if it's just because my OS or computer is old, but if anyone can help me that'd be great.
Thanks.

we're taking her to the vet for her first check up in two weeks, when she's around 8 weeks old.

she'll go under my bed and just lay in the corner, but will come trotting out if I get a toy. she's eating fine, drinking fine, still playful.

why is she having .. tummy issues? help.

TITLE:  Have to uninstall Google chrome, asks if I mind losing my browsing history ... is that okay?
BODY: I downloaded Open Office but somehow apparently allowed it to switch me to Explorer and the extensions on all my wordpad documents changed to something open office-y. I called my computer guy and he's going to switch the extensions back for me later but said to uninstall my Google chrome and then go in through Explorer and reinstall it.

When I went to uninstall it, it asked if I wanted to erase or minded if it erased my browsing history. I think the answer would be I don't mind, but it's the weekend and don't wish to bother my computer guy, so just thought I'd ask you. Any insights appreciated.

TITLE:  My cat died in my arms and I don't know how to handle this?
BODY: Two days ago my baby that I've had since I was 3 years old passed away in my arms. She was a 16 year old siamese and a few weeks ago she started acting strange and stopped eating. About four days ago she got too weak to move at all, so I stayed in the living room with her and had to hold her up so she could eat and drink. I know it was gonna happen, but I held her all night and she cuddled up to me whenever I tried to move, and she was whimpering in pain and gasping for breath, I was crying and told her it was okay to let go and I loved her and then she just took her last breath.. I haven't been able to deal with this, I don't know how I'm ever going to get over her.

I first thought it was my molar sinking in somehow, but when I was brushing my teeth, I went to check what it was and it was a gum flap. This honestly scares me since I don't know what to do. Please tell me what this is. Thanks.

TITLE:  Seriously, what is wrong with me?
BODY: Ok, so, Hi, im a 17 yr old male, and recently after constipation, I found problems. So let's start with mental and outer symptoms. I have a bump and I think a tear (maybe?) near/on/around/in the anal cavity. It hurts, imagine slamming your finger between something. It feels like that. I also have (i have regets but also glad I did this) put my finger in slowly to just examine, and it feels like my intestines are bunched up near the entrance. Also, I have not pooped in 3 days now, i am having small minor cramps (the non-painful ones but they have a pressure), also there's spots of blood and some light brown goo every time I wipe after GENTLY "pushing" to try and releive anything there. I plan in seeing the doctor Monday, but i need to know wtf is happening, and if there's anything I can do... Sorry if I was gross about it... Thanks in advance for any advice!

I also tried form the System preferences settings but it doesn't allow me. There is only another account on this Mac and also doesn't know how to remove it. It says it needs the Admistirators username and password. Do i need to reset the entire Mac to remove it ?

Evertime i try to search answers on to how to remove them, the website is also blocked.

TITLE:  Can you help with part of an idea for my tattoo?
BODY: I want to get a tattoo of a picture taken of me swinging in San Francisco with a view of the city. It symbolizes travel for me. I want to get this picture in the shape of something instead of just a rectangle like the actual picture.  Do you have any other ideas of shapes/things I could get this tattoo in? The best I can come up with is a heart. :/
Thank you so much!!!!

TITLE:  Is there something to be worried about here?
BODY: A few weeks ago I was moving stuff down my stairs when I tripped and fell and cut my arm on some tile. I went to the doctor and he told me it was healing fine and for the past 2 weeks I had been applying a prescribed medicine to the cut. It started to scab, and yesterday that scab finally came off. It left a long punk scar, as I had taken out a few layers of skin when I cut my arm. However today I noticed a bubble like thing on top of the scar, covering about half of the scar. I covered it with a bandaid and plan to return to doctor on Monday if does not go away. Is that bubble like thing something to be worried about??

Also, cheap(er) brands that are good and can be found at Target/Walmart?

TITLE:  Is my parakeet pregnant or dying?
BODY: So I have 3 parakeets, one a male and 2 females
The green female i recently noticed is just laying on the bottom of the cage on her stomach.
She doesn't even move.
None of them ever let me touch them but lemonade is just laying there so I pick her up and her legs are like spread apart and her stomach is real big and bloated and there's a brown colored line running down her stomach.
She can't even walk around and stuff, she just lays there.
Her wings are fine but I'm what's wrong with her.
My mom thinks it's lack of water because it's been so hot out but why would her stomach be bloated from lack of water?
She had a few clumps of poop on her but so I wiped it off with toilet paper
Her tail is kinda puffy and she can't balance right.
My mom won't take her to the vet so that's out I'm the question.
Oh and I'm going 2 be a freshman so it's not like I'm 8 years old

TITLE:  Why does my cat act weird?
BODY: About a year ago me &amp; one of my friends found three stray kittens in a thorn bush. I took them home and took care of them, but my parents made me give two of them away. I got to keep the only female, a siamese that was actually really shy. 

Over the year that I've owned her, I've noticed she doesn't act normal. Unlike most cats, she HATES being pet/being picked up, the only way she shows affection is by being in the same room as me. She doesn't even lay in bed with me or play with me.

She never rubs her head on me or groom me, she never sits in my lap or sleeps on me..

In fact, she never plays with bugs around me (She only plays when she's alone) and, when she gets annoyed, she doesn't hiss or growl, she never scratches me or bites me.

I also actually never see her during the day. Like, she's always hiding from me, and the only time I see her is when she's eating or if she casually decided to come into my room.

Does she hate me? Is she afraid of me? Please help!

TITLE:  Maggots in hamsters food!?!?
BODY: My little cousin got a hamster about 2 days ago and we bought the food for her from the same pet shop her bought from. Anyway we set her cage up and feed her then water her all by about 6:30-7:00 pm. The next morning my Nannie called me and said she just noticed there were maggots all in the food we bought so I grabbed Teddy's (the hamster) bedding and some of my rat food and we cleaned the cage out and threw away the bag of food and gave her my rat food until we went to Walmart to get new hamster food. Anyway my Nannie said Teddy is acting weird today. She wasn't running on her wheel, she tried to bite my cousin and sister, she won't even go in her house, she just wants to sit in one corner and not move. Could this be because of the food she ate? What should I do?

TITLE:  Why do my silkie chicks keep dying?
BODY: So I have a very mixed breed farm I have a bantam austrolorp rooster who mated with my bantam silkie who has a deformity with her beak (scissor beak) and made 2 chicks together (more are still hatching) however both chicks have passed away while the other chicks that are not silkie chicks thrive

The first one lasted 2 weeks then the "stargazing" condition took its life next the other
passed away in the night although it was dead in its water bowel so maybe it drowned?

Idk but I'd really like a silkie to work out for me because I find them so beautiful. Do you think it's a genetic problem? Or coincidence

TITLE:  USB drives not working write on MacBook Pro?
BODY: The USB drives on my MacBook Pro OS X Yosemite version 10.10.2 has been acting up. I'll plug in my external hard drive or dvd writer and I can tell they're being powered up but nothing displays on the desktop. No evidence that it's being plugged in. There have been times where it functions just fine and no problems at all but mostly the first situation. 

SD cards work just fine and thumb drives are read too just fine. Only issue was that MS Word documents on them are not recognized however there was a time when they were recognized just fine.

Anyone have these issues and know any tricks? Why is the reading of these devices inconsistent?

TITLE:  Buzz Cut Length?
BODY: So tomorrow I am getting a haircut, and I have decided to get a buzz cut because it is very hot now. I haven't had a buzz cut since I was very little, so I don't remember it much. However, I do have pretty short blonde hair. I wasn't exactly sure what length to get, but I'm thinking about either a number 2, 3, 4, or 5 on the top. Should I get the same length all around or just one length? What should those length(s) be? I also want to have it feel and look like a buzz cut, but not show much scalp. Also, I want it to feel very cool (temperature wise) because I play a lot of sports. I also don't want it to become of fuzzy and weird when I take a shower. If you have any pictures then that would be great.

TITLE:  Introducing a cat do a new puppy?
BODY: I have a 3 year old cat who has never seen a dog except once and it ended in the dog being clawed. I would love to add a puppy into our mix but I don't know how to properly introduce them.

Since my house is full of cat friendly things such as cat walks and shelves where my kitty can sit way up high by the ceiling and look down at the on goings of the house. scratchers and toys. there are plenty of ways my cat could escape a puppy if he doesn't want to be bothered. 

BUT introductions, introductions, introductions. How do I introduce a puppy to my cat?  Thanks!

She mostly goes to the bathroom in her water bowl and I clean that out daily. So there's not really any messes in the substrate.. The tank is huge and weighs like a 100 pounds. It's gonna be hard to clean even just once a month. I'm willing to do it, just wondering if it's a necessity :)

BODY: There is a Harvard Study saying that fluoride may reduce your IQ and there is all this controversey about fluoride being bad for you. However, has anyone ever really had anything really bad happen to them because of their daily intake of fluoride? Such as brushing teeth, drinking water from tap, consuming foods with high fluoride and so on. I read that green tea and black tea have some fluoride in it to but yet I don't know if I am being affected or not by fluoride.

TITLE:  Basketball or soccer? Can I quit basketball without being a loser?
BODY: I moved about 3 years ago and I haven't done much sports except volleyball since I moved. I used to play basketball and soccer throughout grade school (2nd-5th grade). I started to try out basketball this summer, but I'm awful since I'm a sophomore now and the last time I played was in 5th grade. I'm considering telling the coach I'm not up to basketball anymore. None of my friends play basketball and I don't really feel welcome (I don't have fun playing with them because they are all really good and I feel like I am hurting the team) Sports should be about having fun, so I want to get back into soccer. Do you think I can try soccer as a sophomore? I used to be really good at soccer. I really need someone else's opinion because my head hurts from thinking about this so hard. I just don't want to quit basketball and have everyone asking why I quit. I'm not a quitter, but when I'm not enjoying it, it's not worth it. I can't do both sports because I have a job and I don't want to miss tons of work (money) for gas money and my phone bill.

At first I left them in there thinking they would just stop in a few minutes but when I came back there was blood everywhere. The female has blood and scratches all around her face and the male does too. 
I separated them and now he Is in a different cage but I want to know if it is only because of her being pregnant or if they will never get along again. I just feel bad that they are alone now..

TITLE:  5 week old kitten?
BODY: I have recently adopted an abandoned 5 week old kitten from the animal shelter and I was wondering if anyone could give me some tips on how to take care of it. I know the basics but I would really appreciate any details like how often, how much, and what brand of food to feed her? Any toy suggestions? Whether or not to get a collar? How dependent will she be on me? Should I let her sleep with me or make her sleep in her kitty bed? Is it likely for her to get too attached to me, her being so young? Any extra details. To be clear I have researched and watched many videos on these things but I just want to be sure she has the best life possible. Any suggestions are welcomed:) ps. im really worried because she is so young without a mother. Thanks to everyone who responds!

I got reduction surgery the day after I broke it and I'm getting another surgery to have plates and pins put in, in two days. Can you tell me in detail how the surgery is going to be? I'm really nervous. Do you get to choose between a boot and cast after surgery? How long did it take you to be walking normally again? Just tell me the whole healing process in detail. It's my first time breaking a bone so I'm really scared. Thanks!

TITLE:  What is causing my lower back pain?
BODY: So I've been running for 2-3 months now. Nothing extreme, only 4,5 km, and for about 1-1,5 months now my left lower back has been in mild pain after running. I started doing strength exercises to strengthen my back muscles and my core, but the pain still didn't seem to go away.
About three weeks ago I went out on a run like normal. But about 1/3 into the run my left lower back muscles started tightening up and hurting like crazy. I thought it might go away if i kept running, so I finished my run even though the pain was pretty bad. 
The next 3-4 days my back muscles kept feeling tight and hurting even though I was stretching out several times every day. Now I've been taking a break from running for 2 weeks but my back still hurts a little when I walk long distances. 
I wonder if this pain is caused by my shoes. I've been wearing the same shoes for all the time I've been running (and for the walking too), and they don't have that much support. But the pain didn't start before 1-2 months had already passed. Maybe they were getting worn out? But then why is the pain only in the left side?
Maybe my running form is off. Maybe I pulled some muscle and strained something. Maybe it really is the shoes. Please help me with figuring this out!

TITLE:  Should I get some veneers?
BODY: So I've been living in Korea since 2012. I can't say I have real ugly front teeth, but I have pastas that are too obvious so I laugh without showing my teeth. MY friends always asked me to smile and all  I can do is smile  with no teeth and asks me to show my teeth but I just shake my head saying I don't do that haha. All of my friends have really nice teeth, no, not only my friends, but lots of people in Korea too.  so I've decided to get some veneers. I'll go to my dentist once I get my questions answered. I'm not really sure about it yet soo I'm asking here.

1. should i get the press-on ones or the ones that are attached already by the dentists?
2. if i get the ones that are attached by the dentists, will it last? how long?
3. How exactly do I clean it?

THAT ONLY~ Thank you~ please answer decent questions so that I can set a schedule with my dentist already.

TITLE:  Ruptured Ear Drum Help?
BODY: So, ironically, I was listening to music when someone smacked my ear bud too far into my ear and caused it to perforate. Now I say ironically, because my question is, is it safe to wear ear buds/ headphones with a ruptured eardrum? (On top of being an avid music listener.) I have really bad anxiety and pacing around with some music seems to be the only way I can complete my everyday responsibilities. If I continue to listen to music so close to the eardrum, will it cause pain or slow down healing? I'd appreciate any answers, I'm not sure I could last weeks without some form or music to keep me calmed down.

BODY: So I have a dell inspiron I5 desktop and I got a used gtx 650 to improve my graphics. Well now I need a bigger power supply to power this graphics card, so I got a EVGA 500W power supply. I plug the new power supply in and it won't connect to my monitor (monitor is an ASUS VS228H-P 21.5-Inch) So then I take the power supply out and try reinstalling it. Then it wouldn't power on. Finally I put back my old power supply and everything works. My question is should I return the power supply and get a new one or return the graphics card? Or do I need to buy a new desktop? 
Thanks!!!

TITLE:  How to lighten hair naturally?
BODY: So here's the thing.I have dark blonde hair,and it is winter where I live,and the lower layer of hair,like the hair that grows from behind my head/neck(hair that gets the least sun exposure) is now noticeable darker than the rest,it is brown,like a light /medium brown.And it bothers me because it stays that way towards the ends as well,so I end up having blonde and brown ends and it looks bad.So I'd be happy if I could just lighten the ends.Any ideas on how to lighten it up? Thanks

CPU: AMD FX 8320E OC 3.5 Ghz
RAM: 8 GB DDR3 1600
GPU: XFX R9 270X 2GB DDR5
OS: Windows 7 64 bit

I can run NBA 2K15 with all set to high setting with AA 8x.  The game runs smooth now after some tweaking with the BIOS.   That game is pretty demanding regarding the Specs it can run on.   So does it mean I can run any 2015 games smoothly?   I don't need a 60 FPS.  A 45 FPS is good enough.  Need your feedback.

TITLE:  Is it okay to leave my cat at home ? HELP ?
BODY: I'm going to the beach with my family tomorrow, we won't stay there the night we'll just spend 5 or 6 hours there and come back home, My cat hates to get in a car, and i can't take her to the beach she'll absolutely die there or get lost, She's an indoor cat, and she doesn't like to go out at all, And i can't even take her cause the car is too small there's no place... So anyways, is it okay to leave her at home alone ? With plenty of food and fresh water ? The house is safe, there's nothing that can hurt her in here, But still i'm worried, is she going to be okay to stay alone 6 hours ? I really have no choice, i never left her more 4 hours in my life, at all, it's the first time i'm traveling and leaving her behind, What do you guys think i should do ? Any tips ? Thankyou

It looks pretty dumb having little wispy hairs that curl up sitting in my fringe and makes it look way too poofy at the sides! Someone please tell me how long I ll have to put up with these stupid little buggers! Thanks!!

I got home and came to see her (I did it calmly). She was sleeping on my floor and then all of a sudden took off running (with her eyes still closed!) And freaked out. Now I can t get near her. Her beard is black, she opens her mouth, puffs up, hisses, if I try to touch her she bolts again. I think she s scared because she was isolated and I thought she would adjust to us again having my family be around but we have been home for hours and nothing has changed. Ive been careful to not approach her from above but it doesn t help. Should I try to pick her up anyways with a sock over my hand? I don t want to scare and traumatize her but I don t know what to do. Please help.

She s 7 years old btw

TITLE:  Are my teeth going to be okay?
BODY: Over the past two weeks, I have been committing terrible acts. I rarely eat sweets, but my demon, the sugar-dragon inside me took TWO weeks of my life. 

I'm regretting these past two weeks because I've been binging on Snickers, M&amp;Ms, Skittles, and Sour Punch Straws. Usually I would never do this, but since the candy was given to me, I just wanted to enjoy myself. FML.

Today (Saturday, July 18th) and this past Friday, Thursday, and Wednesday, Skittles have destroyed my health, taking a huge toll on me psychologically. I know how bad the PH is in this candy but the flavors... During these three days I ate 3 to 4 packs a day, usually in one sitting to avoid the acids during the course of the day.

I brush my teeth twice a day, floss, and use a fluoride mouth rinse, but I know diet must also be up to par for a healthy mouth.

I'm just worried about the damage that has already been done to my enamel. I have noticed yellower teeth after these past two weeks, but no sensitivity, etc.

I'm ready to quit this crap, but will my teeth be okay, or have I hurt myself, affecting the future health of my teeth?

TITLE:  How do you handle sly and subtle disrespect.?
BODY: I use feel like i was being paranoid,  but now I realize it's true. I have a neurological condition so I look nervous all the time. People gossip and speculate a lot about me. Some wise guys play this game where they try and do passive aggressive stuff to prove whether I'm weak or not and show out infront of people, but it's never direct to me and its always below the radar type stuff. When I call them out they play dumb or **** bricks.  Like today I was in the gym on the heavybag and I think this trainer was talking **** about me. When he was close to me he wasn't, but when he was far he would slip it into conversation with someone.  I don't want to go around like a crazy person interrogating people, but when I walked to him to see what he does he put his head down and looked nervous. What should I do about sly insults and these games people play.

I have Hikari Bio-Gold pellets &amp; Hikari Bio-Pure freeze-dried bloodworms and I currently feed him a few pellets and then later in the day I feed him a few bloodworms, close to evening. Also I heard of feeding bettas only six days out of the week to give their digestive systems a break. Is this correct?

I was doing some research last night on how to care for them, and I found that their fins can grow 12 inches tall. I just want the best for these fish, and if it means returning the Angels to the store, so be it. And the angelfish get along just fine, they were in a tank together, and they haven't been aggressive so far. Thank you!

TITLE:  Reptile owners help!?
BODY: I recently purchased a baby gecko that's about, a month old (bought him yesterday). They said a couple months but there's no way, when I purchased my other two geckos they were ten times the size of this baby. Anyways... He/she has lost its tail and is very underweight. The other geckos he was with fought over food and you can gues how that went for a baby.

 He looked to have sheded recently so we gave him a Luke warm bath because of the old skin still sticking to him. It's obvious he has a Vietnam A deficiency... So one of his eyes are closed and we clean around his eye and put a couple drops of water near it and it's obvious his eye lids are swollen but his eye is clear. No puss that I can see... What should we do? The pet store we bought him from told us to just bring him back and they'll let us have a "healthier one" and not do anything for the geckos eye! 

Let's just say I wasn't to please to hear they didn't care about this geckos life. Or how he could go blind. 

So please, any suggestions on a remedy to get his eye better? And no the pet store doesn't carry eye drops for reptiles... Seriously what do they do when their animals get sick!? P.s he's eating fine and seems to have a big appetite for a baby. We've been giving him calcium dusted small crickets and a few meal worms to get his weight back up. And the crickets for nutrients.

TITLE:  How can i whiten my teeth without damaging them?
BODY: Im turning 16 in 4 months. My teeth are really yellow since i was kid (only the ones i changed are yellow,the ones at the back are whiter). I used to use baking soda with my toothpaste,and once i used baking soda with lemon(its kinda dangerous,but it didnt even do anything). i went last year to a dentist and he told me tooth whitening cant be done cause im way to young and might damage my teeth and that i should be 18 and older.(i searched on google,and people say that it can be dne from 16 and older) Its sounds legit, but i really need this whitening, i hate looking at my teeth, imagine how other people would feel, i cant smile,laugh or even talk with feeling embarassed. a few weeks back i went to my local pharmacy and asked them for a teeth whiten kit,they gave me one...it was for 5 days..it didnt do that much of a difference,you can barely see it. What should i do? Its even really hard for me to find a bf, i mean who would i want a girlfriend with yellow as **** teeth.Any help? should i go to a different dentist?

TITLE:  What medium sized fish would you recommend in a 30 gallon tank?
BODY: Hello! I just got my 30 gallon tank yesterday and it is in the process of being cycled. I don't want very colorful fish because the tank has a nature green background and all the plants are green and so is the decorations for them to hide in. It basically looks like a swamp. Therefore I don't think colored fish would look good in there. I really want cichlids but I hear that they are a lot of work to keep healthy. Also I hear that they will dig up your plants in the gravel and it took me sooooo long to get the decorations perfect in there lol. So that would be annoying if I had to fix the plants all the time. (The tank is freshwater btw) I was also thinking about freshwater angel fish but idk I kind of wanted more than one type of fish in my tank. Give me some suggestions please! Thanks

TITLE:  My cat has skin scabs and vet doesn't help?
BODY: I have taken my cat to the vet numerous times for this and she doesn't help, I don't think she truly knows how to help him because nothing has worked.

He has two major things that seem to be related to one issue; he coughs and his skin is covered in scabs and he is over grooming because of it. The vet insists that it's alergies/asthma. I have an inhaler for him which doesn't seem to help, but I use it anyway because the vet said so. He still coughs. As for his skin, the vet prescribes him a prednisone which is a steroid. She has prescribed this Everytime I have taken him for these symptoms and they don't work! I am so frustrated, I don't know what else to do for my poor cat. To make things worse he is a little older and has a heart murmur, so the steroids are risky and they don't even work. He also is on a special d/d duck prescribed cat food for his allergies... I hope I can get some insight with the information I have provided. Any kind of advice would help. Thank you!

Honestly it's just for fun because he just wants a dance and doesn't expect it to be anything  super real, plus I'll still be fully clothed (shirt/pants). He just wants to get danced on. I don't mind and I might as well make the most of it. But I've never done this before. Anyone or strippers out there with some good ideas for a steamy lap dance? Moves only. I have no intention of stripping down for him.

Would it be ok to lunge him for 40 minutes or so tonight like once every two days he would get worked twice until he's back at his usual fitness? He's on hardly any feed just enough to put his supplements in. Would that be okay to lunge tonight in his roller and side reins for a few weeks to get his fitness back? I wasn't sure if twice a day work would be cruel...

TITLE:  I've had tendonitis for a year and a couple months on and off. Help!?
BODY: So when I got tendonitis I stopped playing in orchestra for a couple months and then gradually resumed.  I also stopped playing piano for awhile and I still can't play piano till this day without all the pain. I went to the orthopedic doctor and he felt my wrists and said it was tendonitis not carpal tunnel. So I've been wearing wrist braces at night for awhile. It wasn't till the end of the school year that I was able to play in orchestra again without that much pain. By the way I play violin. So I noticed that the pain lessened when I didn't feel much pain afterwards. I did feel like my wrists were tired and slightly burned after playing though. Some weeks it felt like this others it didn't bother me at all. I bought an nsd spinner for my wrists during the year which made my wrists and forearms and they  felt better and stronger but then the pain gradually came back and went away again. So I really just want to get rid of this permanently!!!!! I'm thinking about buying another nsd power spinner thing beause it seemed to help before. So now it's the summer and whenere I try to pick up a violin or play piano after I'm done my wrists burn and tingle and I don't know what to do! Ty[ing doesn't bother my wrists that much. I remember though when I first got this condition it was so painful that I could hardly even open a door or lift a grocery bag. Now it occasionally feels sore especially when I'm done playing and instrument. So what should I do? Thanks

BODY: I sent a friend request to someone a few weeks ago--or, I thought I did. No big deal, he didn't accept so far. But when I clicked on his profile, it didn't say "Friend request sent" in place of the button that usually says "Add friend". So I also went and checked the page that says "friend requests sent" on my behalf. He was no longer there either.

Basically, is this cuz he proactively "deleted" my request on his side? Just curious! No biggie. I wanna know that I sent it for sure the first time, that's all.

OS: +0.75  -1.00   X 009

Could someone explain to me what exactly this means? And on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being the worse, what does my vision fall up under? I've always heard my optometrist way my right eye is significantly weaker than my left eye, but that's all I know.

BODY: I m looking to build a new PC, I m somewhat on a budget, and I was thinking about starting with a Pentium for now, and moving up to the i5/i7 when those prices come down whenever Intel releases the next generation processors. 

I know what socket platform I want to build on, 1155, but within LGA 1155, there s several chipsets, which one gives me the best value and balance between cost, performance, and longevity.

This computer will start out with general use and light gaming (starcraft 2, CS:GO,), but eventually will be upgraded if I start to get back into PC gaming.

I d like to think that component lifespans are getting longer now, the last computer I built was only top of the line for 8 months before it started to struggle, this was back in the P3/P4/Athon XP days. But now it seems stuff just lasts longer, I have a laptop with a Sandy Bridge i7 Quad Core and a Radeon 6750, and it s 4 years old and still giving me pretty good performance.

And of course I m not only looking at Intel, but I honestly don t know much about AMD, there s so many chipsets and platforms nowadays. AM, AM2, AM3.

Can someone give me the gist of the AMD side of things, and give me a basic system platform/config to look into? I will probably be going for an AMD video card as I ve always been a fan of ATI hardware over Nvidia.

Thanks

TITLE:  I have a question about dying my hair.?
BODY: I have a pompadour like style.
No hair on the sides or in the back.
It is like a half Mohawk like kind of style.
The hair I do have is medium length.
I want to dye just the medium length hair red using the l 'oreal excellence magenta with the developer.
My question is, because it is a small amount of hair that I want dyed, do I use a small amount of the dye and developer or just how much should I use for each use?

BODY: I wanted to change the school name listed under my name beacuse I m going to college now.

So I deleted the name of my graduate schools and I changed it to my undergrad school.

But then I see that in search results, it shows my photo along with my name and my location but not my school name underneath. 

I tried to find help on Help Center and people explained that if it doesn t work it s due to your network. 

So I checked the Networks on Seetings but I can t edit it or even see it !
It only says "Your primary network will appear next to your name."

But I can t see and can t figure out how to add a primary network ! I don t see anywhere to choose a network !
 
Can you please help me ??

BODY: So basically I got my third rat from the breeder for free because she is 4 months old and has this rare eye condition that could cause blindness and or interocular pressure causing bleeding and severe pain. The breeder has a CO2 chamber for if she is pain. But seeing how this could happen any day, is there any over the counter pill or anything I can buy to put my rat to sleep or to calm it before being gassed? Apparently the CO2 chamber can make them choke and over all be scared, so I'd rather her be relaxed.

I've never had my jaw hurt after getting cavities filled, and I've had some filled before. They said my jaw might hurt a little for a few days because of holding my mouth open for so long, but it's been almost a whole week and the pain isn't really subsiding. Any ideas as to what might be causing the pain in my jaw? It hurts in the very back of the left side of my jaw.

TITLE:  Only 1/4 parakeets wings are clipped?
BODY: I just got into the exciting world of parakeets a little over a month ago, and I now have four parakeets. I got three from PetSmart and one from PetCo. The one from PetCo came with its wings clipped, and I didn't notice until I got home and she couldn't fly. Whenever I let all my parakeets out together, the other three take off, and the one from PetCo tries to fly with them, then smacks into the bottom of the cage, the table the cage is sitting on, the floor, ect. Should I take her back and get a parakeet that doesn't have clipped wings so that she doesn't hurt herself?

TITLE:  Missing teeth question (braces)?
BODY: I am 16 years old and I have had braces for about 3 years and a half. A little over a year ago I had my two upper canine teeth removed. I wanted to know how they are going to be able to close this gap? I have had my braces for a long time now and I do not want these gaps to take long to close through my braces. I did some research online and some people have gotten fake teeth or bridges to close these gaps. Will this most likely happen to me? Because I feel really insecure about my gaps and want them to go away!

TITLE:  Do you think my older cat cares about my younger injured cat who s one cage rest?
BODY: My 2 year old cat had been hit by a car and she s gotten 3 fractures in her hip :( She is on a strict cage rest now with meds . This all happened a day ago so it is all new to my older cat. She has been trying to walk and sniff around the cage in a curious manner and then today I saw that she went right next to the cage and lied down. She seems to want to be around my injured cat more. The weird thing is these two don t really get along but more like tolerate each other and coexist before this all happened. Does anybody think that my older cat is actually feeling sympathy for her and in a sense guarding her ? Oh and I also want to know if anyone has ever dealt with an injured cat similar to my case and how did they heal?

TITLE:  Dying hair back to natural color?
BODY: I originally have dark brown hair. It's really dark to where some people think it's black. I ombred it blonde at the salon one time, then I redyed the blonde red. I want to go back to my original color without having the ombré still there. I just want my hair to be its original color again. My question is, do I have to bleach everything so it can all be one even color then dye it dark brown, or will it be even if I use a dark brown dye over all my hair?

TITLE:  What cat food brand would you prefer?
BODY: I've owned my cat for about a year now and she's really disliking Whiskas brand. She used to like Whiskas and ate it like there was no tomorrow, but now when I give her her bowl of Whiskas she just stares blatantly at it, meows at me like she's saying "Why?", but she eats it anyway.

I think she's sick of eating it! What other brands would YOU and your cats prefer? 

Thanks!! :)

TITLE:  I require assistance formatting a hard drive. Can someone help? Thanks!?
BODY: I'm trying to format a hard drive that I'm going to use for a new PC build. Its a 1 tb hard disk. I followed instructions on how to format it but I wasn't given the option to do so. Here is the website for the formatting instructions.

https://www.hgst.com/support/faqs/how-format-my-drive-windows-only-ntfs

I am running windows and I followed the instructions but when I right clicked to try and format the hard drive I couldn't click on the formatting option. Here's the list of my clickable options:
Open
Explore
Mark partition as active 
Change drive letter and paths
Shrink volume
Properties
Help


So that is the list of the clickable options. Any help? Im going to install a new operating system but that will be on a 120 gb SSD as my boot drive. So any ideas on how to format the hard drive? I already backed up the whole drive on an external one so I'm looking for options here. Thank you!

TITLE:  My Mom wants to give away my cat!?
BODY: I have a cat named Candy of 4 yrs, and she is like a sister to me. I also have a dog named Kobe of 7 mths.
My cat has recently been tested positive for e Toxoplasmosis, and my mom wants to GIVE HER AWAY!!!!
Toxoplasmosis does no physicsl harm, but it has passed down to my mom, The virues does NOTHING if you are not pregnant, and my mom is way too old for that.
This cat is my pride and joy. I have had her since she was a kitten and have never given the thougjt of letting her go.
My mom also wants to.get rid of her because she can have an attitude and be mean sometimes, but my cat has lived with us to the point where we let her outside to take long walks by herself no supervision, and she ALWAYS comes back in 15 minutes. She is a very shy reserved cat scared of every human but mg family and I know for a fact Candy cannot handle going to a stranger's home

I REFUSE TO LET GO OF THIS CAT
How can I change my mom's mind- and quick!

TITLE:  HELP! Is my fish okay?
BODY: I have a betta and he's not even a year old yet so he's not old. A couple weeks ago I noticed and heard him running into things in the tank and when feeding him, he didn't seem to know where the food was, causing me to believe he can't see very well now for some reason. Now, he can't stay up straight and when he's not trying to keep him self up, he starts to turn vertical. His tail is also seeming to be wearing away. Many times, he has been laying on the ground, and when I walk past, he swims around the tank very fast and then lays back down. I do leave uneaten food in my tank, and yes, I know it's bad and algae is also in it. My fish has been like this for about a week and I'm afraid he doesn't have much longer. He doesn't really come up too much, but when he is, I tried to feed him and he can only get one or two because he misses them. At least he's eating tho. I want to take him out and put him in a small container while I clean the tank and get rid of uneaten food, but because he can't see, I'm afraid he'll keep running into the small container and scare himself to death. So my questions are, is he okay? What do you think is wrong with him? Will he die? How can I help him? Thank you so much and I apologize for how long this is.

TITLE:  My guinea pig always seems to be mad at me?
BODY: Hello. I purchased two pigs from PetCo around April. They are only a few months old, but my one pig ALWAYS seems mad when I pick him up.

My other guinea pig is honestly the sweetest pig you will ever meet. The other piggie never enjoys being picked up. He constantly chatters at me and makes whinning noises. He bites and fights with my other pig when holding the two together.
I clean their cage twice a week, give them fresh veggies as well as hay and pellets. He doesn't show any signs of illness. I really don't know what to do.

Thanks, Bella.

TITLE:  My mom wont let me dye my hair blue?
BODY: I'm 18 and over since I was 13 I wanted to dye my hair blue. In the past my mom has let me dye my hair black and brown. I was finally excited to be 18 to finally do blue. I wanted to try it out because I really like it. Anyways she was like no even though your 18 you can't your gonna look like a freak. I talked to my friends and boyfriend. My friends were like if you want to do it go for it and my boyfriend just said you will look beautiful as always. I don't see why mom can't think that way. I think I should be able to make decisions like this for myself because it does not effect her in any way whatsoever.  Its not even her hair and it's not like my hair hasn't been dyed before. I only wanted to do it for the summer for 3 months and then I would go back to a natural color for college unless they allow unnatural colors then I would keep and maintain the blue hair for a little bit longer.  But she still says no you will look like a freak.  I don't know what to do anymore. I try to tell her I'm expressing myself but she just argues and nothing every turns out nice. For once wish she wouldn't be so controlling. And I know its not good to dye your hair and stuff gosh I still want to. It's only gonna be like the third time I've dyed my hair which isn't too bad.

TITLE:  Wisdom Teeth Removal - When can I stop worry about dry socket and start eating normal foods again?
BODY: Okay, so I got 2 of my wisdom teeth removed on Wednesday at 3:00PM. It is now 4 days later and have very little pain except for a little soreness in my bottom socket. I also have no swelling. Right now, the socket is the same color as the gum surrounding it.

The past four days have been hell because A) I have only eaten mashed potatoes, soup, jello, and pudding and I'm running out of soft food options. B) I have been terrified of getting dry socket every time I eat or drink something, and C) I try not to put too much air back there so I haven't been able to talk normally. I've extensively searched this on the internet and some people say you are safe to do just about anything you want after 72 hours - some say it could take 1-2 weeks. 

So my question is a) when can I start eating normal foods again like pizza, chicken, french fries, veggies, etc. b) should I be talking normally by now or does talking disrupt the blood clot? c) when am I mostly safe from developing dry socket? 

Thank you!

TITLE:  What is the brand on this horse?
BODY: We know nothing about the brand, can't find it anywhere. It looks like an S with an upside down V  beneath it. The horse was purchased in auction. We believe her to be thoroughbred/quarter horse/paint/haflinger, or something along those lines. I know it may be a long shot because it is probably a farm or ranch brand, not a breed brand, but anyone know? Thanks!

TITLE:  Why do I have bad breath?
BODY: I brush my teeth 3-4x per day using Sensydyne toothpaste. I use crest total protection (no alcohol), I use act dry mouth rinse. I use a tongue scraper twice per day and my tongue appears clean. I floss every night. I do not use mints, but chew xylitol gum. My tongue appears clean and my dentist has never said much wrong with it. I have tested for key paid and do not have any. When I lick my wrist I smell a subtle smell. My mouth doesn't seem dry. I just feel like my breath is bad and the lick test sort of confirms. My girl friend hasn't kissed me in a while and when we had kissed there would kiss for a while French there would always be a bad smell when she talked  after wards. Before hand she had just a slight breath smell. Is it her breath or mine? When I make out with my arm in the same way I can't replicate that smell. I use C4 pre work out that has caffeine and stimulants everyday but I also drink plenty of water.

TITLE:  Ways to ask a girl out with a poem?
BODY: I wrote her a poem and I want to know some ways to ask her out with this poem.
Every time I am near her I get butterflies in my stomach And every time I am around her I feel like a fool 
Because her gorgeous face leaves me at a loss for words 
Her sparkling eyes leave me dazed 
Her smile brightens even the darkest place 
And even when I'm down it brings a smile to my face Whenever I hear her angelic voice it soothes me 
Just the very thought of her gets me through the day 
My heart skips a beat whenever she says my name
 Just hearing her name takes my very breath away 
And if I had one wish it would be to spend time with her And maybe one day it could become a reality 
But instead of wasting my time thinking about it
 Or hopelessly wishing upon the stars 
All I desire is that she answers this question 
A question I ask with all of my heart 
(crush's name) will you go out with me?
  
She is into poetry and knows I write poems but what you think?

BODY: I don't enjoy smiling in pictures with my teeth open, and people tell me that I should. My teeth are straight, it's just that my two front teeth are uneven with one longer than the other. My breath on the other hand, I've been told smells and I brush two times a day and floss. They look yellow, and I don't smoke and I've tried bleaching for which it didn't work. I brushed for about 5 minutes at my friends house once, and she looked at me confused and I was ashamed. I'm having to chew gum, or having a mint to make things better. My lips as well are super dry, and I use many moisturizing lip balms that don't work. What could I do?

TITLE:  Is my fish set up okay?
BODY: I have a 75 gallon tank with two angelfish (not a breeding pair, but both are very docile and are kind of like Deb and Flo from Nemo; always staring at their reflection, and kinda clueless). I also have one rescue betta, he's a spade tail, and he doesn't even flare at his own reflection. He's very active and adorable. Then I have two fantail goldfish who keep to themselves. They're docile to the extreme and really sweet fish. I also have one bristle nose place, who, yet again, keeps to himself, and three golden mystery snails. The bottom substrate is black sand, and I have a very large filter. There's ten live plants, some caves, and I clean it regularly. Is this okay? Thank you!

TITLE:  Darkness in one eye?
BODY: I am a 21 year old healthy female and a couple times now I have found that after I turn off the lights to go to bed, I feel like there is a shade over my right eye in which my vision is shrouded. Just minutes before I turn off the light I am usually on my cell phone with the full brightness on, I don't know if this could have something to do with it? When  I cover my left eye and I can see just fine, and when I turn the lights on I can see fine. It's just when I turn the light off, my eyeball feels very tight, and it looks like everything is covered with a curtain. This condition is very temporary as it only lasts a few seconds to a minute.  I'm freaking out because all websites say it's MS or a retinal detachment. Can anyone offer any insight on this?

When I play CS:GO, sometimes during a gun fight, my mouse would click out leaving me unable to control the mouse in game until I click again causing disruptions. Similarly, when I'm simply chatting with friends, the mouse clicks out of the chat box causing me to re-click on the chat box in order to type.

I wanted to know how they are going to be able to close this gap? I have had my braces for a long time now and I do not want these gaps to take long to close through my braces. I did some research online and some people have gotten fake teeth or bridges to close these gaps. Will this most likely happen to me? Because I feel really insecure about my gaps and want them to go away!

TITLE:  Is boxing with headguards still bad for your ears?
BODY: around two years ago i had a major ear surgery on my left ear, I specifically had a ear cartilage put in and also had my ear canal reconstructed. I am starting gym in a few days and I want to know whether its okay to spar with headguards, I asked my doctor if I could do sparring but he said if I get right hooked into my left ear I could lose my hearing temporarily untill a ear surgery is performed to put the cartilage back in place. But I am assuming he meant boxing without headguards, because these headguards have ear padding around the ear area which prevents a punch from pushing into the ear. And also I can still do sports like swimming, football, cricket etc.

When I found out that my hair was high porosity I did a lot of recommended things to keep it moisturized. Loc method, green house effect, finger detangling, everything. My hair is still super dry, dull looking and more breakage than before. I researched and found that high porosity hair is damaged hair so I tested it. I cut off a small patch of hair into three sections. The ends middle and root. All of it was high porosity. Does this mean it's all damaged? I need help natural haired gurus!

It says that I'm still friends with him so I know that he didn't unfriend me. Could I be blocked from his page? I can still see everything on his timeline though. Is there a reason why I can't see any of his pictures/videos? I'm just thrown off because it says we're still friends, but the pictures won't show up.

BODY: Over the past two weeks, I have been committing terrible acts. I rarely eat sweets, but my demon, the sugar-dragon inside me took TWO weeks of my life. 

I'm regretting these past two weeks because I've been binging on Snickers, M&amp;Ms, Skittles, and Sour Punch Straws. Usually I would never do this, but since the candy was given to me, I just wanted to enjoy myself. FML.

Today (Saturday, July 18th) and this past Friday, Thursday, and Wednesday, Skittles have destroyed my health, taking a huge toll on me psychologically. I know how bad the PH is in this candy but the flavors... During these three days I ate 3 to 4 packs a day, usually in one sitting to avoid the acids during the course of the day.

I brush my teeth twice a day, floss, and use a fluoride mouth rinse, but I know diet must also be up to par for a healthy mouth.

I'm just worried about the damage that has already been done to my enamel. I have noticed yellower teeth after these past two weeks, but no sensitivity, etc.

I'm ready to quit this crap, but will my teeth be okay, or have I hurt myself, affecting the future health of my teeth?

TITLE:  1 year later and still dealing with hip injury. What do I do now?
BODY: I am a collegiate runner. Ill be attending a university in the fall (transfer from a community college). Okay so long story short I injured my hip last summer from a cable work out (my leg got jerked back with a strong force). I've had multiple physical therapy sessions, 4 X-rays and 2 MRIs (that revealed nothing) and 1 cortisone shot (a month ago) and I'm still having pain. The pain travels from the groin area to the side of my butt (like a strong nerve type pain). Also when I touch the bone (femur i guess) part of my hip its pretty tender. It is now a year into my injury and I'm still not better. Should I try to get it checked out again or should I just accept the fact that this might be a permanent injury and just run through it?
P.S my new coaches are aware of my injury and I don't want this to interfere with the next season since i was forced to miss conditioning and (this) season at the school i transferred from.

TITLE:  Getting hit on the head?
BODY: I kind of freak out whenever I hit my head because I already get frequent headaches and have hit my head a lot. But today my mom knocked on my head as a joke, but I got elbowed around the same area 3 wks - 1 month ago. I feel pretty tired which happens when I'm hurt or think I'm hurt. This is probably an overreaction but should I be concerned?

TITLE:  Cat's worms aren't going away?
BODY: My two indoor cats often get tapeworms, but the medicine from the local pet store doesn't seem to get rid of them?
After the time it says for the worms and eggs to die, we then give them flea medicine. But then after a week there are just more worms! There is no way I am able to take them to a vet, I simply cannot afford it. I'm  afraid that I won't be able to help them properly, and they'll suffer [perhaps even die] because of it. 
I just don't know what to do, I'm going to go buy some de-wormers from the pet store later. Any advice?

TITLE:  Sick kitten!HELP! URGENT!?
BODY: We went to the store and got a new kitten who looked lively and healthy when we got him. They told us he was eight weeks old and that he ate dry food. We tried to get him to eat dry food and he wouldn't eat it. he only ate a small amount of wet food that we gave him and then he threw it up. It took us a couple of days to realize he wasn't eating because he would put dry food in his mouth ( turns out he was spitting it out. ) Took him to the vet turns out that he is only six weeks! We have him on kmr, dry food with gravy on top, and a kitty supplement. His diet is better,he has an appetite again and he is eating and they treated him for worms at the vet.
NEW PROBLEM: His ear is down, he is scratching it,he is still very lethargic even with eating food and now his meow is silent when it was loud. I just don't know what is wrong! 
They ran all the bloodwork and tests and we won't know until Thursday. Anyone have any idea what could be wrong with him?

Plus the thunder are back, the suns are always fighting for the bottom 7-8, and don't hate, but I think LAL will be in contention for 7-8 because that kobe is determined, of course theyll lose first round but still! 

I think
1. LAC
2. SA
3. GS
4.OKC
5. MEM

TITLE:  I clicked on a yahoo article that sent me to PC Advisory website, Has this ever happened to you?
BODY: When I clicked on this link, under a yahoo beauty article (you know how they advise another article you may be interested in? Yeah, one of those) from its main page, it took me to what look like a broken link.  The website gave some cryptic warning of safari suspicious activity (sounds like total malware/scam) BUT, would not let me close the page.  It kept showing a number to call saying I wouldn't get access to my browser until I called the number.  I am pissed because this was through YAHOO! And under their help link, there is nothing to address false links.  I had to close my tabs through Force Quit, then re-open it while holding down the shift key to close all tabs.  Safari will keep tabs up from previous sessions every time, even after you shut down safari, so I was kept in the bogus PC Advisory loop.  I don't know if this has ever happened to anyone, but if you find yourself in that position, I hope this helps.  I'm pretty pissed it happened to me.

TITLE:  How to make people not freak out about me wearing a wig.?
BODY: I am 15
So I have a short pixiecut. And I have naturally. But I still wanted the ability to have long hair aswell. So I bought a wig. 
The school year is coming up. And I don't want people to freak out over me wearing a wig cuz its nothing to be all dramatic about. I don't want to hear the questions "how did your hair grow back so quick?" 
Why do you wear wigs?
Why did you you cut your hair so short if you wanted it the same before you got it cut ect. 
I just don't wanna deal with dumbasses freaking out. 
Any advice?

TITLE:  CAT IS ACTING LETHARGIC, RUNNING A FEVER, DROOLING, SNEEZING AND HIS EYES ARE DROOPING. DIAGNOSIS?
BODY: My black domestic shorthair cat, Raven is sneezing, running a fever, keeping his mouth open, drooling, and acting lethargic. He is a male cat about 1 year old, and was a rescue. We got him around when he was 4 months old and other than being dehydrated and hungry, he had a checkup and was fine. We are afraid that he might have gotten a spider bite, because one of our previous cats had gotten bit by a black widow and showed the same symptoms and then became retarded. He is my sweet little "Ravie" and I would be crushed if something horrible were to happen to him.

I took him to the vet a couple months back for it, they prescribed him an antibiotic and painkillers. Well the antibiotic didn t work. She said if it didn t work, he would most likely die a painful death. It hurts me so much I just want to help him but I can t euthanize him for at least another week. I can t find his painkillers and I m curious if there s any painkillers for cats I can buy or even natural remedies (that actually work) to at least make it less painful for him???? Please help he s laying in the bath tub crying right now

Anyways, our budget is $8,500 for the horse. I'll most likely bring my trainer with me when I go 'horse shopping' so she knows what to do. my main concern is buying the right breed. If you have any tips on buying a horse, please share them with me! Thank you!

TITLE:  Can I get fusion hair extensions on grown in patches of my hair from alopecia areata?
BODY: Okay so I've had alopecia through out my childhood on and off. The patches are quite large and just starting to barely grow in. I'd say they're like a prickly stage. Maybe 1/8 of an inch long. But the rest of my hair that covers most of the baldness is extremely long. And I have a lot of it mostly on the top. The sides are my only issue. The rest of my hair is about 24 inches long. I have about 3 months until my senior pictures. I'm assuming in 3 months my hair will be at least an inch, maybe an inc and a half long. Do you think I could attach fusion hair extensions onto the short/inch long pieces of hair to blend it in and make my hair look normal for my pictures and prom?

TITLE:  I think I might have torn my meniscus?
BODY: I went running, which I do about two times a day, and I felt a shooting pain in my knee like it needed to pop. I kept running on it cause I thought maybe it would pop and feel better but it popped and still felt like it was cramped up. Twisting my knee hurts very badly &amp; there is no swelling. In everyday activities it doesn't hurt at all really but if I run it starts to hurt and it hurts after that for a few days until I stay off of it. It hurts to squat and when I bed my knee at all, even to walk or get up but if I straighten my leg when I walk and don't bend it at all it's totally fine. I need to go to the dr but I don't want to get an MRI if it's something small and treatable. Does anyone know what these symptoms are?

TITLE:  Questions on book 1776 by David Mccullough?
BODY: Answer any you can. 

1)Could King George III have done anything differently in 1776 to avoid war, or was it inevitable at that
point?
2)How important was Washington’s role in American independence?
3)How did Washington try to overcome his failings? Was he successful?
4)Why did people respond so positively to Washington?
5)Was Congress right not having Washington attack Boston? Why do you think Washington wanted to attack, especially when nobody else thought it was a good idea?
6) Mccullough writes: “And as with everything connected to that role—his uniform, the house, his horses and equipage, the military dress and the
bearing of his staff—appearances were of great importance: a leader must look and act the part” How much of Washington’s ideas about appearance and presentation do you suppose was influenced by his living under a monarchy?
7)What were some of the biggest differences between the warring armies, and how did they affect the
battles?
8)What wins a war? Number of troops? Talent? Leadership? Supplies?
9)Is it necessary for the soldiers to truly believe in the cause in order to win the war?
10) Are there any parallels to be drawn between the American Revolution and our current military conflicts?
11) How do you think modern English citizens would feel about this book and its portrayal of their history?
12) The author chose to focus on a single year: 1776. Was this adequate to tell a compelling and clear story?
Do you feel like there are things you still want to know?

TITLE:  What does this elastics configuration do?
BODY: I have a strong rubber band that hooks to my very back left molar, then i stretch it and go around the hook of my top left canine, and then it hooks at my tooth directly to the left of my bottom left canine. It creates sort of an upside down V shape.
Thanks for your answers!

TITLE:  Needing braces badly, but poor! What do I do?
BODY: Hello, I'm sixteen years old and I recently took a trip to the orthodontist. She looked at my teeth and told me that I needed braces. I have an overjet, and I think she said overbite too if you can have both at the same time (the trip was like a month ago). I  have overcrowded teeth and two crooked on the bottom,  I also have a tongue thrust. My orthodontist gave me a discount of $4,500 instead of paying $5,500. Not only do I risk health problems, but I'm super self conscious and low about it. The issue is my family is poor! Like poverty level, and I don't know what to do, I'm stressing.

TITLE:  My cat is bleeding and losing hair, what is wrong with him?
BODY: okay my male tuxedo cat leo was born October 2013. so next October, he ll be turning 2. he has always had problem with, as my veterinarian calls it, "feline acne". okay so I looked it up, and treated him with the cream, and the "feline acne" started to clear up. it would go away for a while, and return, and I would put his medicine on him again. I think I should have been putting it on him whether he had broken out or not, but the past is behind me. but now leo is behind repair. but anyway, he all in the sudden, pretty recently, just broke out so bad like I d never seen him before. he s losing hair everywhere on his face, he is bleeding everywhere on his face, ears, and chin. I have one other male cat tiny, a bengal, who is only 2 months younger, but he is physically stronger than Leo. so when I noticed hair missing on the back of leos head, it looked a lot like tiny might have accidentally bit Leo a little too hard while playing around. but lately, that spot has lost even more hair since. I don t understand what s happening to my cat. i feed them both Iams wet food and dry food. i always clean his bowl, so its not that. I m going to the vet tomorrow, because they are closed today, and i ll hear from them. but I don t think this "feline acne" anymore. this is serious. I appreciate any ideas that you might think it is. thanks so much.

BODY: It's not corrupted or anything like that. The port on the hard drive itself, that I use to connect it to my computer came loose and so my laptop is no longer able to reliably connect to it. Sometimes if I hold the wire to my external  hard drive's port a certain way I get lucky and my MAC is able to shortly read the hard drive. But if I shift, it says that it disconnected right away. I just want to be able to able to extract all the stuff from my external into a new one--help : ( ! 

So where should I go? Or if any suggestions, what can I do ? Any help is appreciated!

TITLE:  Why do people do this on Facebook? Please answer! 10 points?
BODY: So I made a facebook about three weeks ago and sent out a lot of requests on the first day (and now I just get them and not send them). I have about 250 friends.

The thing that annoys me is that I sent a request to someone and they don't respond to it for a long time, and then they do respond to it, and I realize (from the bar on the right), they are on facebook very frequently. Why don't they accept it right away? When I get requests, from people I like, I accept them. If I don't want to be their friend, I decline. For the record, some don't bother me. Because some of the kids genuinely don't use facebook often (for example, someone went two weeks without responding, but once he did, I noticed he was never on Facebook) or they don't accept friend requests for a while and just do it all at once. The thing I don't understand is some people have been accepting other requests, but they didn't accept mine.

And I read previous answers (looked this up online) and some people in the past said; "maybe they don't want to be your friend so they didn't answer it.", some perhaps, but I have pretty close friends that simply don't respond. Like people I have hung out with and talked to pretty frequently for three years. And they are friends with some losers but they haven't accepted mine.

Even some take a long time but eventually do respond, just I wonder why? Do they not like me?

I was thinking a bird (lovebird or cockatiel) or a small reptile. 
*also if a bird is a good choice what type of birds are easiest?*
Something on the cheaper side is good
Any ideas would be great

TITLE:  What should I do? Old or new retainer?
BODY: My orthodontist told me to wear my retainer for 6 weeks right after I got my wisdom teeth removal . But that was the one he made me of my screwed up teeth with my wisdom teeth in. They had pushed all my teeth forward. But my teeth have gotten better since the wisdom teeth removal. I still have my old bottom retainer but it's chewed on from my dog and its looser than it used to be. But it's the shape of how my teeth used to be. And I'm still in search of my old top retainer. 
Anyways what should I do? 
Wear the crooked tight retainer? Or wear my old retainer that's loose but of my straight teeth? 
I didn't want to wear the new one he made me a couple of months ago because I feel it would just make them go back to how they used to be when I had my wisdom teeth in,  all crooked.

BODY: So the other day, I cut my toes, &amp; I cut my big toenail a little short, I noticed it was sore a couple days later, I then hit the same toe on a door &amp; it was super tender &amp; hurt really bad. I figured I had an ingrown toenail or something but I just let it go. the next morning I woke up &amp; it was all read &amp; puffy, I squeezed it &amp; nothing happened but i knew there was pus in ther so I opened it up &amp; sure enough I squeezed it out, I thought it was all okay, but it didn't get any better throughout the day. so I got Epsom salt &amp; soaked it in that, then put polysporn on it with a bandaid &amp; I keep doing that off &amp; on throughout the day. It also hurts like a mf to walk on, touch, soak, ect.

It is slowly getting better, but I wondered if someone had suggestions that work faster for them. I am planning on going to the doctor tomorrow, but I'm also looking for home remedies that will make it go away soon because I'm leaving Thursday to go to sandego &amp; id rather not have this open thing on my toe at the beach. Thanks(:

TITLE:  Thick, curly, frizzy hair?
BODY: I have struggled with taming my hair for years and cannot seem to find any solutions to control it thus far. My hair is very dry, curly, and frizzy all of the time even though I take good care of it. I condition it everyday, don t use heat often (maybe a few times a month?), and don t color it. I ve tried tons of products with no luck. I also have tried hair masks, such as  coconut oil, which only help temporarily. I am not willing to buy super expensive products, but is there anything I can do to make it silkier and more controllable? My ends always seem very dry but the roots and middle are usually okay. It also doesn t lay flat due to the thickness and frizz. If i straighten it, I have to wait a couple days after before I can wear it down which is super annoying. Any tips would be helpful!

TITLE:  What did I do to my foot? Will I be ok for my performance? HELP?
BODY: Ok so I got a lead in my summer musical, but thankfully I don't have any dancing. Anyways, I was doing something stupid this morning and I jumped off something not too high but I landed roughly on my heels and my left heel then started to have sharp pain and I got dizzy for a minute so I got water and sat down. When the pain subsided I got up (couldn't really put my weight onto it) and got some Advil. I then had to go to a festival but I got these heel gel things to protect it and it was mostly fine like I didn't limp. Later in the day at home now it really hurts when I put my weight on it and I have to limp. There is no bruising or any swelling at all. There hasn't been at all today. It feels almost like there's an internal bruise in my foot but I'm not sure. I've been icing it and resting for a few hours but I'm scared. Next week is tech week and I just need to be able to walk around normally and the performances are in a few days. Will I be ok? My character shoes are very tight and compressing and I'll bring the heel gel things to slip inside the shoes so I think it's ok, but is this something serious? I cannot give up this performance, not now. What do I do? HELP PLEASE!!!

BODY: I am hitting all my golf shots decent but I want to improve. I shoot in the high 70's usually. My coach said sometimes I take my back swing back to far and my swing gets steep. I struggled with a little fade so he closed my stance with my shoulders. And on my downswing sometimes my arms follow through to left and I know they should be towards the target but sometimes i can not do anything about it. I sometimes slightly hook the ball with my irons and fade the driver. Any advice?

BODY: Hiiiiiiii

So, my mom and I are going to the hair salon, barber- whatever, the hair cutting place. And I really want my hair shorter, not like a pixie or even a bob, but just more shaped and shorter. Right now my hair is medium longish and REALLY PUFFY. This Was the conversation:

Hey mom, you know how we're going to the hair salon soon?

Yes

Well I wanted to get my hair cut and shaped a bit more, just like 2-3 inches maybe?

What? Nooo you should grow it out about 2 inches.

Mmmmmmm no, I really don't like it though!!!!!

But it's so nice!!!

Meh.

Uh.... We'll see ( sarcastically)

So how can I convince her?

Thanks for the help!!!!

BODY: I straighten my hair everyday and I'm starting to notice my hair getting brittle, so I figured I might as well try and embrace my curly hair instead of flat ironing it every day. 

But I seriously don't know how to take care of it or the best way to style it. I have very fine hair, but it curls like mad. Is there a certain way I should be washing/drying it? Ways to style it? How to keep curls in tact and looking neat?

Anyways, she was havingtrouble with pellets so iI switched to live earthworms and she loves them. Deciding to up her eating excitement I went creek walking and added about 25 minnows to the tank for her to eat in addition to the worm every other day. Within three days she ate all the minnows except 4, and 3 worms. So the question is will this hurt her? (I plan to not repeat this)

He's a double tail half moon. He's like a dark teal green with a tiny hint of purple. This may sound stupid but I love him just as much my other pets. He's kinda spoiled.

BODY: So I had a key on a lanyard I brought out to a boarding barn and within the first few minutes of being there, I seemed to have lost it (it was in a back pocket and I'm not sure if it fell out or what but all I know is that it was stupid to carry it around like that, I know). I'm really worried that a horse there ate it. Do you think a horse would consume a key with an entire lanyard?  The key is about 1.5 inches long and 1/2 inch wide- that was the only key. None of the horses seemed to be acting strange, even though I'd been there for about two hours after I noticed I lost it.

BODY: Yesterday I noticed a fairly large, hard bump in the roof of my mouth, near my back teeth. Normally, if I have an infection in my mouth I bleed it out, but this bump doesn't bleed. Its become painful to the point where I don't even want to eat and has gotten larger. I tried to look at it using a mirror and it appears to be bright red and oval shaped. What is this bump, and what can I do about it?

TITLE:  BEARDED DRAGON HELP! :(?
BODY: I was told Her tail was bitten off by her siblings, it was healed already so it seemed fine. He took her out&amp;immediately she began running away from his hand .He let me pet her but she kept trying to escaped&amp;was really quick.I held her and she seemed to stay for a bit but then the same thing again.This was my first time buying a beardie so I thought maybe since she's young she's acting like this. I brought her home and took her out the next day. since then I've taken her out everyday for 15-40 minutes. she would kept trying to run and jump off chairs so I bought her a reptile leash. I have her on my shoulder most of the time, she chills there for a while. She has fallen asleep on me a few times too.
However, I heard so many good things about beardies being really social I expected her to be Nicer? Although she is ok when she's out, she still runs away from me and squirms when I grab her from the cage. I've tried slowly approaching her, I've tried leaving my hand in there for 10 mins. She just doesn't seem to like being held. i want a bearded dragon I can hold and 1 I can have out without going crazy when I place them on the floor. Is this normal behavior 4 a beaded dragon? She's about 4 months old I think. Should I wait more? Any tips? I'm just frustrated&amp; it sucks havinga animal that doesn't like me :( the shop keeper said I can always exchange her for another but I feel bad 4 her. Not sure if i should get another or keep trying with her? Just need advice.

BODY: I sold a concert ticket to a stranger in my area, who contacted me through Facebook. After we met up and made the transaction, she messaged me again asking for some form of photo ID. I thought she just wanted to know that the tickets were legitimate so I covered my address with my thumb, but the second after I sent the photo, I completely forgot to cover my driver's license number! Even if I block her from Facebook, I can still access the messages. My address was the only thing that I blocked out. I'm freaking out right now! Can she do anything with that information? What should I do now?

TITLE:  Hair cut with layers! Read below please :)?
BODY: First think first is that I want to say is that my stylist does exactly what I want and not whatever she wanted so I wanted to know if I should ask to take off 2 inches instead of 3 inches when I get layers because I wanted to know if when you get layers if the stylist has to cut off a little bit more than you ask for on the ends to get the medium layered look? Basically what I want to know is getting a layered hair cut going to take off more hair at the ends (im talking about length not layer length) than getting a regular hair cut? Like if I ask for 2 inches for a regular hair cut and I do get only 2 inches cut off rather than getting a layered look and asking for 2 inches but really getting like 3 or 4 inches cut off??? Basically do they cut off more hair at the ends for a layered haircut than a regular hair cut??? Yes I know layers are different lengths obviously I'm just asking aboutthe overall length of the hair like when your hair ends, thanks sorry I'm not good at explaining things

TITLE:  Torn labrum? need help?
BODY: ok, so in November of 2013 i was tumbling in cheer and i did a back handspring and my shoulder felt like it shifted or something ripped i guess. I dealt with the pain and kept tumbling for a while. About a month later it happened again but this time it hurt more. I rested it for a while iced it and just stayed off of it and when i got back into tumbling it happened again.long story short it happened about 6 times in a year. I finally decided to go to the doctor in February this year and I got an MRI and he told me I tore my labrum but it s not bad enough to need surgery. He gave me a cortisone shot in my shoulder and gave me some exercises to do at home and i took that and started doing it. I also started working out my triceps, biceps,deltoids and chest on a regular basis at the gym. My shoulder doesn t seem to be getting better and it seems to hurt more. I play some volleyball with friends and one time i served it hurt and had a ripping sensation. I have had this ripping sensations multiple times since the shot. I guess my shoulder just feels unstable and it is not really pain but more uncomfortable. It does hurt to an extent but I guess its manageable but I would like to be pain free. I think i need to go back to the doctor now because it is not better. Does anyone have any ideas on whether it may be more than my labrum or what else I can do to make it better and more stable?

TITLE:  Can't connect to facebook at all on my phone?
BODY: So out of the blue the other day, my iPhone stopped connecting to facebook. The problem exists with Facebook messenger too. Now it seems like it's not an app specific problem because going to facebook.com on Safari gives me the error: "Safari cannot open the page because it could not connect to the server". Also when I go to settings and try logging in from there, it gives me an error like "cannot connect to the Internet". This only happens with Facebook, and being connected to WiFi or 4G makes no difference. This is on an iPhone 6, running iOS 8.1.2. I have restarted several times too, so please don't make that suggestion.

I was wondering what exactly would happen if I didn't wear the brace as often as I should? The brace causes me a lot of discomfort. It's hard looking up things online bc most people who get the surgery are in their 40s through 60s and I'm 18 so information online varies significantly and doesn't pertain to teenagers

BODY: I've been told my teeth are small or that they look like baby teeth. I'm really insecure about them and my voice. I have a lisp when I say my s's. I'm 14 going on 15 and I'm pretty sure that I lost all my baby teeth already. I'm pretty sure that I've always had a lisp, but I was never put into a speech program. My teeth are pretty straight but I have a slight overbite and my teeth are pretty spaced out. I always thought about getting braces, but I'm not sure if it would help my lisp or make it worse. I also have TMJ. (Top picture is me smiling, Middle is just my teeth clamped down, and bottom is of me saying my s's) Thank you.

TITLE:  Computer resolution problem? Need any help I can get.?
BODY: So my monitor is a smart TV by Vizio. I have a home built PC. This has been working fine until I updated Windows today. The resolution turned weird. After the update everything is big and blurry. This is odd because when I checked my resolution it was on the max setting at 1920x1020. Seriously everything is big and blurry. My taskbar, browser, and all the sites including this one in the browser are all big and blurry. I have tried switching to lower resolutions and restarting- Even searching for solutions on google but I can't seem to find anything. Anyone know of solutions?- For size, everything is twice the size it used to be- Nothing is cut off the screen though

TITLE:  What should I do about my ankle that buckles while jogging/running?
BODY: I need to know what I should do about my ankle problem. I remember around 5 years ago while I was playing volleyball someone came down from a block and landed on it. Had to wear active ankles after that which I think made it worse (weaker.) stopped playing and everything seemed fine until recent months. I will be jogging to my car and my ankle will just buckle and give out on me. i ignored it until 2 months ago I was at the gym running 8 mph and all of a sudden I just fell face first. I luckily caught myself on the side bars and pulled myself off of the moving treadmill. (wishing I clipped that emergency stop onto me that night...) I sat down and touched my ankle on both sides and it felt bruised but didn't turn black and blue. It did swell up though. The whole week after it was a little painful when id walk but nothing too bad. Currently, it still hurts when I turn it certain ways and I'm nervous to run again. Any suggestions on what this could be and how to fix it without going to the doctor. I want to be able to exercise again!!

TITLE:  What is Track &amp; Field like?
BODY: Okay, so I want to do sports next year, and I'm really good at sprinting, so I figured that I could do track. I am actually close to overweight, so I really want to do something to lose the weight. What is it like? I am bad at distance running... It took me almost 12 minutes to run a mile, which is NOT good. What are the tryouts like (what they tell you to do) what are the expectations... Ect. What is the whole experience like basically. I wanted to do volleyball, but idk how to play it, so I figured that track may be a better option. Thanks for the help! I appreciate it.

Btw, this is for 6th grade track and field.

TITLE:  I found a baby bird in a park, help? (I think it's a sparrow)?
BODY: I found the bird in a crowded park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Several people were saying it fell from the nest, but I'm not sure if anyone saw it happen. I was worried he would be stepped on or ran over by the park ranger's carts. The park ranger didn't know how to help, either. It was running around &amp; chirping frantically. so I took it home.  It's completely feathered but very small, so it may be a fledgling, but there was no nest/parents nearby.

I put it in a cardboard box with a paper towel, a little grass, and wet cat food. It's on my fire escape, and he's asleep. He's doing well, although in the car he wasn't moving much (I think he was too hot, it was 95 today). I was planning on letting it practice flying everyday, unless it decides to stay. Should I take it to a wildlife center, or will it be okay?

TITLE:  Tattoo scabbing causing scarring?
BODY: I woke up last night and noticed that I had a scab hanging off part of my small inner forearm tattoo. I'm guessing I scratched it as I was sleeping. It's annoying because I've been SO careful not to touch or pick at it 

Underneath, there's no blood or anything, but I can definitely notice a bit of moistness and what I presume is ink. I am aware that what has happened is pulling out of ink and I will more than likely need a touch up. I'm not concerned about that, but I'm concerned about scarring. What are the chances of developing a scar if the scab was enough to pull out ink, but not to draw blood? I have kicked back into gear in regards to to applying bepathen ointment on this part of the tattoo and continuing my normal cleaning process. Only worried about scarring - has it happened to anyone and what does it look like?

TITLE:  How can I find a lost, dead Samsung Galaxy S3 phone?
BODY: Today I went out and had my phone in my bag. After going to many places, I arrived home. I then went to a relatives house and noticed it went missing from my bag. So when I went home I tried searching all over for it. My uncle called my phone but it went straight to voicemail... Meaning it's dead. So I went on various websites in searching for a solution but none of them worked. In Google Play I downloaded Lost Android. Didn't allow me to open. So I went on google and typed where is my phone. It was unable to locate it. I then searched on google location history, I went on today's date and saw various pinpoints of places I don't recognize at all. But when I go to the day before, I see the places I have been to. I got home around 3 pm, and when I saw the last history of today it was at 6:30. Which was when I couldn't find my phone, and it showed of a persons house. But I honestly couldn't believe whether it was true or not, and it's pretty late right now and I don't want to bother anybody in driving me all the way to that persons house. And for the Samsung account, I don't know if I had one made or not. So I did one but it's not much help. 
I told my mother of the situation and she said I'm in DEEP ****. Which is not much good at all. And said that I should be more responsible, which I am. In fact this is the first time I even lost my phone. Idk if this helps at all but the phone was given to me as a hand me down from my mom.
Please help if you can!!

TITLE:  SARPE appliance left permanent scar on tongue?
BODY: I had a surgically assisted rapid palate expansion almost 3 years ago now. The RPE appliance always pushed on my tongue when I swallowed, and even made contact when my mouth was relaxed. I d wake up with a deep indentation from it. Im one of those weirdos who likes to mess with things like canker sores - so you can imagine I constantly poked and prodded at the groove especially where it was the deepest, "the sweet spot." It has been years and I was always told the mouth heals the fastest but remnants of the groove remain. And oddly enough the tissue has absolutely no taste buds inside and the area tends to feel tender if I eat something spicy or something really cold like ice cream.  The groove spread across my whole tonuge and looked exactly like the appliance before. Now it seems just the center of it which included the part id purposefully injure, are still there. Anyway- is this normal? Will it ever heal all the way? And am I going to get oral cancer now? Also I am a smoker.

Just before I went to vacation, I used the computer and it works perfectly.

Is it because of the main PSU or PSU cable that cause the explode? Cause I have similar problem with my PS3 and it turns out to be the cable.

TITLE:  My cat split her wrist pad?
BODY: I held my kitty today and noticed her wrist pad (aka pisiform) was cut open. My mother and I cleaned the wound with hydrogen peroxide and then glued the half split pad together with some nail glue (low quality surgical glue) we also put a cone on her. I know I should probably take her to the vet but we are very very poor and only live off 1000 dollars a month during the summer, so even visiting will be costly. I'm wondering if what we did is a good way to help her little paw. Thank you

TITLE:  Need help with tattoo ideas?
BODY: I would like to get a tattoo, but whenever I try to think of a good one I go blank.
I want something small on my right wrist, can be a symbol, small picture or words (Or either two with words underneath) that will symbolize overcoming 7 years of depression and suicide attempts - one attempt in particular that got me 2 minutes close to being dead, the anniversary of that date being February 20th 2013 (If that might be incorporated in it, but it doesn't have to) - and being clean from a cutting addiction for 3 years. I want it on my right wrist because that was my cutting arm (With completely faded scars now, not even there anymore)
I want something simple and moderately small to sum up all those events - I also forgot to mention I do NOT want the semi colon. Everyone does that and I want something symbolic for MY challenges I have overcome, but I just can't think of anything.
Thanks in advance!! :)

TITLE:  How can I get my cat to let me hold her?
BODY: So I rescued a 14 year old cat (yes I know she's pretty old) and I've had her for about a year now. She's really friendly, but she's won't let you pick her up. I know she likes everyone in the house because she lets up touch her and rub her belly, she'll follow you around the house. But we have never held her, because she'll dig her nails in the couch and won't move! I told my brother maybe it's because she's old and already set in her. He's 10 and always wants to play with her and hug her, but she's not having it. Any advice ??? (P.s and how can I get her for tearing up the couch,because my mom is getting new furniture, and if she doesn't stop by the time she buys her furniture which is soon. She's planning on giving her away)

TITLE:  Why has my hair growth been extremely slow all my life?
BODY: So I'm a 15 year old female that has never had long hair. I have short curly blonde hair that reaches my collar bone. I've been growing my hair my whole life and I've never cut my hair more than a trim. I usually have about two appointments a year to trim my hair in which I clearly state to only take off the split ends and it's always about the same length after. And even after 15 years of this my hair is still short. I do have cousins that had the same problem as me, but by the time they got to my age their hair had gotten really long, while mine is still stuck. It's frustrating because I feel like I've tried everything to make my hair grow faster and it just keeps on growing extremely slower than the normal person. I do keep my hair in good condition and I've been trying to stay away from heat products. My doctor thinks that some of my baby hairs are stunted while some grew and that in a few years it will start to grow. But that was a while ago and im still seeing no results no matter how hard I try. I've struggled with this since I was a very young kid and all I've wanted was long hair. How can I grow my hair faster? (Btw I've tried things such as the inversion method, oil treatments, hair pills, and homemade natural hair masks. These things do help but have never shown me big results, and trust me I've been patient with my hair for many years) 
Thanks in advance!

TITLE:  Minor getting a tattoo?
BODY: I am 16 years old and would like to get a tattoo. I live in Oregon and (as far as I know), I am not allowed to get a tattoo until I'm 18 even though I have full parental consent. However, I will be in Nevada for part of the summer and was wondering if I could get the tattoo there? I'm not sure exactly what their regulations are, but I know that they are far less strict than in Oregon. Would the fact that I am from Oregon and still technically live there effect my ability to get a tattoo? any help would be appreciated! 

p.s. the tattoo is a reasonable and meaningful one, and easy to cover up, and my parent is 100% on board with it, so while I am willing to wait if there is no other option please no comments about how I should because I am young. thank you!

leaving ourselves with a pure but fragmented image.

people call it a romanticisation,
but that fails to capture its horrific nature. 

for in idealising the past, you neglect the present,
which is where you can really rid the ills of life,
instead of having to pretend they never came to be.

TITLE:  Was this a coincidence how I chipped my tooth?
BODY: Ok so I never really chipped my tooth like this biting my finger nails. And 3 days after I get a DUI I was stressing out more than I ever had before buting my nails and chipped off a chunk off the back of my bottom front tooth. It made the tooth pretty thin at the tip. Now I wonder if this was a coicidence and it could of been any other day biting my nails to do this to my tooth or was it really related to my DUI and how much I was stressing biting my nails extra hard? I did have a small crack running across the tip from left to right but just seems so ironic I did this 3 days after DUI.

Are there certain shade of blonde  that would look better on me? I've linked photos to help give an idea of skin tone, face shape, hair color and length. I've also linked the hairstyle and color I"m going for. Any advise would help. Thanks!

This is for cross country. Honestly, my first season, ever. (In college)
I plan on getting up soon 6AM to run 4-5 miles. And keep running daily till I fly back to school.

TITLE:  My cat has fleas! What are some recommended products I should use?
BODY: I noticed today that my cat (almost a year old) had a very small bug crawling on her. It was extremely hard to see, and as I was trying to pull it off of her fur, I noticed another one crawling through. My boyfriend and I immediately went to the store to buy a flea killer product: Hartz UltraGuard Pro Drops for Cats over 5 lbs. It was the only one at the store at the time, as it was late at night and we wanted to treat her ASAP. Well, we got home and followed the directions, just like it said on the back of the box. Probably 30 minutes later, I decided to look up reviews on the product to see if anyone had any success. There was only one rating over 3 stars; the rest were 2 stars and below. Some of them were saying how their cat lost its fur where they applied the product. One customer's cat actually had a mini seizure and died! My boyfriend wanted to wash the medicine out of her fur. I was hesitant because one of the directions was NOT to wash the medicine out 24 hours after using it.

Well, he washed it out, and now it has been another 30 minutes since that happened. I tried looking through my cat's fur, and I saw more of the fleas crawling around. I tried to get them out, but she was squirming around and I couldn't get her to stay still.

Please, she is like my child and I don't want her to be in pain! I need people with experience. What are the products that you used? Did you buy a flea comb as well? Did you vacuum the areas she's been around while she had the fleas?

I am more worried about the shot they are going to give me because I am terrified of them &gt;&lt; I had a deep cleaning and avoided the shot and the dentist just gave me numbing gel and the pain for that was not bad at all it felt like a regular cleaning to me. I just really want to know if there is a way to opted out of the shot such as laughing  gas maybe? Or is the shot as painful as a regular/deep cleaning?

TITLE:  Is an air force tattoo cliche and specifically is the air force logo design i want cliche?
BODY: Im thinking about an air force tattoo on my right arm/shoulder. Im thinking that i want the logo to have geometric designs/patterns in the shapes that makes up the logo, and behind the logo have a larger star and 2 wings (right wing would slightly go on chest, left wing would go around toward the and on the back), These would resemble the old Hap Arnold air force logo behind the current one. The tattoo would be meaningful because i was born on an air force base and grew up as an "air force brat". Growing up, the air force has done alot for me. I also joined the air force a year ago so it would represent my commitment and dedication, as well as how i got to where i am currently and where i am going in the air force. Not only that different parts of the logo mean different things, for example, bottom three diamonds in the logo represent integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do. Great values. The Hap Arnold logo part of the tattoo (again the larger star and wings) would represent my "heritage" and my parents who were also in the air force and that was an old logo. Basically i believe this would be a cool and meaningful tattoo and its not that i care what other people think, im just curious of others opinion on the design/tattoo and what theyd think about getting it

TITLE:  Can you control what you saying on laughing gas?
BODY: I'm very anxious about when I get my wisdom teeth pulled. I'm a late bloomer when it comes to teeth so I won't need them out for a couple years, but when the time comes and they give me laughing gas, I'm afraid I'm going to say something that my mom wouldn't want to hear like some stupid internet meme or tumblr post. 
I got 4 adult molars plus 3 baby teeth pulled out winter 2013 because my mouth is too small, and I don't know if they gave me laughing gas or not, but when I woke up I didn't feel at all high and I didn't find anything funny. I was just really tired. They gave me oxygen and an iv and a drug that made me feel like I was floating before I completely blacked out. 
1. Was this a form of laughing gas or just a drug so I would go to sleep? 
2. Just so I won't get panic attacks every time I think about wisdom teeth, can you control what you say and how you act when on laughing gas?
thanks in advance

TITLE:  I have an abscessed tooth and it hurts like Hell!?
BODY: I have a tooth that is completely rotten and broken to the point that it will have to be surgically removed, it is abscessed and it has caused the entire right side of my face to swell up like I was hit several times with a baseball bat. This isn't the first time this tooth has abscessed either, but I can't get it removed because I have epilepsy. I had a seizure in the chair when I went to get it pulled, and now, no dentist will work on me unless I am sedated but I can't find a dentist that does sedation and takes my insurance. I've gotten some pain medication and antibiotics (amoxicillin 500mg) to get rid of the infection, but I'm just way too impatient to wait for the swelling to go down on its own. There's a huge bubble on my gum right above the abscessed tooth. I have multiple questions, so here goes. 

1. Would it be safe if I got a needle and poked a hole in the bubble so that it will drain easier and faster? 

2. What would happen if I tried to pop the abscess like it was a pimple?

3. Is it safe to take my antibiotic with my pain and / or epilepsy medicine? I take amoxicillin 500mg, oxycodone 10mg, and oxcarbazepine 300mg. 

4. Will my antibiotic amplify or weaken the effect of my pain / epilepsy medicine, and vice versa? 

5. What should I be worried about while taking these three medications together?

TITLE:  Why are my dance skills so bad? I've taken dance for 7 years?
BODY: I have danced at two different studios over the course of 7 years (not including all through pre-school). I only took ballet for 2 years at one studio then switched to tap Jazz &amp; hip hop for 5 years and have recently started doing ballet again. I have okay dance skills (beat, rhythm, that sorta thing) but I notice that other girls in my grade who have danced for the same amount of time as me if not less, they have amazing dance skills and can do jetes, many pirouettes and fouettés/a la seconds, and can do many other important tricks such as aerials, high arabesques, tilts, etc. If their dance ability is this great and they have danced for the same amount of time as me, what am I doing wrong? Is it simply because my studio isn't very technical (because it's not)? Or is it because I am not very flexible (I can't do splits)? And if there is another reason(s) you might think my dance skills aren't as good as people who are my age, what is it? Thanks! And sorry for my poor grammar lol I had to write this quickly.

TITLE:  Colored eyeliner or colored eyeshadow?
BODY: So I have light hazel eyes, with some green and brown mixed in. I want to try wearing different shades of makeup to make certain colors in my eyes more obvious. Should I use different eyeshadows (greens/browns) or different eyeliners (also greens/browns)? I'm not trying to look sexy or sultry or anything like that. I just want to have more options when it comes to my day to day makeup.

Thanks!
