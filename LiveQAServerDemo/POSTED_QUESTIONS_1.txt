TITLE:  DENTIST HELP? Fillings? Too high? HELP!!?
BODY: so on June 9th I got 6 cavities filled 3 on my left and 3 on my right. My left side is totally fine I have no pain what so ever. But my right side the second from the back molar hurts so bad. My bottom molar second from the back on my right side was hurting also but I went to the dentist and she filed it down and no longer hurts. She also filed down the top one and it hurts even worse.. It feels like I just need to rip it out to feel comfortable. She also told me I might need a root canal if it keeps hurting. But could I just get it pulled and get a flipper? I go to camp very soon and I don't want to deal with the pain all week and be drugged up! I WANT TO FEEL BETTER!!!! PLEASE HELP!! Also my teeth on my left side are barley touching down when I bite. My teeth on my right touch before. I use to have a great bite.... did her filling them down mess up my bite? Sorry this is so long.

BODY: HelloüòÑ I honestly been stressing out trying to find the right foundation and Color for my skin type! &amp; I'm really failing with help so I just decided to come to yahoo since that's where all my answer usually come from! Lol any who I am looking for the right, best foundation out there I looked at all the foundations online such as giorgio armani, chanel, too faced, bare minerals, bare escuentals, dior, lacquer almost everything! All there foundation has different tones such as I noticed I'm in the dark skin cool tone but my skin also an red with yellow and it's just so hard trying to figure out my skin tone! I currently use the sample from mac 7.5 I don't remember NC50 but I feel it's not the right color, before mac I was using mark kay bronze 2 and bronze 1 for highlight and neither really blend with my skin tone as I would like, and i just really need professional or an great make expert or make up artist to please send me in the right direction for my skin foundation, or at least tell me what my skin color actually may be! &amp; foundation thats also good for skin hopefully thank you!üòò

TITLE:  Eyeliner For Waterline?
BODY: My eyes are pretty small people sometimes tell me I have "Asian eyes" and they are shaped the same way. My crease goes all the way down so it's almost impossible to do winged eyeliner. When I try to put  pencil eyeliner on my waterline it always runs down and I look like I have really bad dark circles or something. I've tried putting black eyeshadow over it but it still runs. For some reason it looks less messy than just putting eyeliner but still, it runs. I've also tried using a gel eyeliner which doesn't stay either. I don't know if there's any specific eyeliners I can use but I don't want to spend money on more things that don't work so getting ideas from others who know my problem would be better. (:

What do you think?

BODY: I have a 4 month old domestic short hair kitten and he's very sweet but he has a biting problem, he starting bit in me one day out of nowhere and it's becoming very annoying. sometimes I'm just laying in the couch and he'll walk up to me very calmly and just bite my hands for no reason, he bites my hands a lot, when I try to pick him up sometimes he bites me.He also bites my ankles, how can I get this behavior to stop or is there nothing I can do about it ? is this a sign of teething ? I don't know what to do, I love my kitten very much but the biting is making me not want to be around him sometimes

TITLE:  How long will a cat stay away from home?
BODY: Hi! My cat is about 6 or 7 months old and I usually see him about everyday but for the last 2 days he has been missing
I have a few theories of where he could be but I'd like to know which is most likely 
1.there have been some different cats hanging around our house and maybe one of them chased him off
2.there is a road above our house someone could have hit him ( I don't think that happend) or picked him up but he is really skiddish of new people 
3. He could've went in the woods behind my house to explore and a predator could have chased him or worse 
4.or he's just exploring around the house because it's summer and it's warm outside and he loves it outside 
Thanks I just want to know which is the most likely

TITLE:  Summer Buzz Cut Length?
BODY: So tomorrow I am getting a haircut, and I have decided to get a buzz cut because it is very hot now. I haven't had a buzz cut since I was very little, so I don't remember it much. However, I do have pretty short blonde hair. I wasn't exactly sure what length to get, but I'm thinking about either a number 2, 3, or 4 on the top. Should I get the same length all around or just one length? What should those length(s) be? I also want to have it feel and look like a buzz cut, but not show much scalp. Also, I want it to feel very cool (temperature wise) because I play a lot of sports. I also don't want it to become of fuzzy and weird when I take a shower. If you have any pictures then that would be great.

TITLE:  PLZ help with contact brands quick!!!?
BODY: So my eye doctor gave me 2 trial contacts andI have to go back today the trials he gave me were 
1) Acuvue moist 1 days , 90 day supply costs $63.50
2) pro clear 1 days, 90 day supply costs 45$ 

Now I have been trying them out and both feel pretty conferable all day. The only issue is a little issue with proclear, because when I put them in my left eye really stings when aI put it in. The only other thing wrong with proclear is that I took it out of my eye cause it was hurting and there was a little chip in it, and one time I took it out and im not sure if my hand ripped it when ai took it out of my eye but it was ripped. So which do you think is a better brand? I mean if it feels conferable all day why not just get cheaper right? Also im 14 and don't really have dry eyes only sometimes thanks so much

TITLE:  22 year old wanting LASIK?
BODY: I'm 22 years old and want to know if I'd be a good candidate for LASIK eye surgery. My left eye is -1.50 and my right eye is only -.5. My right eye doesn't really bother me, but my left eye throws my sight very out of focus and I find myself squinting alot. I do wear glasses, no contacts because they tend make my eyes itchy and dry and even stick to my eye- even with eye drops (I've tried multiple brands of drops &amp; contacts- nothing solved that issue) 

I've had the same prescription since I was 16 so I don't think my sight will get any worse.  Would it be better to wait a few more years or am I a good candidate now?

TITLE:  How long does hair loss last after a perm?
BODY: About 8 months ago I got a perm. I waited a couple of days before showering and since I took my first shower I have been losing hair. I figured it was because of the chemicals and it would eventually stop. It has been 8 months and I am still loosing hair. I have only about 4-6 inches of permed hair left (I keep cutting it off) but I am still losing a lot of hair when I comb my hair or shower. Last time I went to my hair stylist she said it was weird but she did not offer me any advice. Is there something I could do to make this stop? Will it stop on its own?

TITLE:  Please help me I'm in a lot of pain?
BODY: So I just had my wisdom teeth out 5 days ago. I think I have dry socket because in the area where my impacted tooth was taken out, it is causing extreme pain. Also I keep getting a disgusting...horrrrrrrible taste in my mouth. I don't know what to do because pretty much the only way to take away the pain is Vicodin, but when I took that it caused me to get nauseous and throw up. So what are other ways I can manage the pain? I'm going to the dentist today but I just wanted to know now

TITLE:  Cat won't stop biting me -- has been increasing in frequency lately?
BODY: Hi, I adopted a male, neutered one year old cat from the SPCA a month ago. He was the sweetest cat for the first week at home with us. Somewhere along the second week he started clawing and biting my legs during night time. I would ignore her and then leave the room afterwards for ten minutes or so for him to calm down, but the behavior only seems to be getting further out of hand. 

He gets two play sessions of around 15 minutes or so with a wand toy every night, at 8 pm and then at 10 pm again before I feed him his last meal in an unsuccessful attempt at getting him to calm down with some play and then food. He's really engaged in play and tumbles and whips around the rooms, chasing the toy. I never voluntarily let him play rough with me either. When he does start pouncing and scratching, I would snap my finger by his ear and he would let go.

This morning, however, I came out of the room, and he immediately jumped on me and bit (didn't break skin yet) and the finger snapping wasn't making him "snap out of it" so to speak. I left him and did my morning routine in the bathroom while he meowed for attention on the other side of the door. I came out, he seemed better, and I fed him. After he finished his food he hopped on my lap looking for some petting, but within seconds that escalated into biting and clawing again. I've been looking up on this type of behavior on a lot of sites now and it's all pointing to play aggression and attention-seeking. How can I stop this?

TITLE:  What was France like during the French Revolution?
BODY: I'm writing a book and the main character goes to France during the french revolution, but in order for my story to be accurate, I need to know several things. 
What it looked like, important people at that time, government officials, culture, what the woman and men wore, how woman and children were treated and pretty much everything else.
I also would like to know if Assassins Creed Unity is a good source for what France looked like at that time, and some other brief history things. 
Finally, I also need to know why and how the French revolution started.
I've looked all over the web it seems, but I can't find a good source on many of the things, like what the woman wear (I know they wear layers, but I can't find anything that explains it) and many aspects of the culture. 
I haven't taken world studies yet (I will next school year) and anything I've found about the revolution is high on politics and I don't understand it. 
Does anyone has some information they know from memory or any good, understandable sources?
Thank you very much :)

TITLE:  How do I maintain my Biracial hair in box braids?
BODY: Hi i just got my hair braided into large box braids about two days ago and i know that ill have to wash them 
eventually so that they last longer. Im black and puerto rican and my hair is naturally curly. ive watched a 
few videos on how to wash braids but becasue my hair is different i wont need as many products to moisterize. so basically im just trying to figure out how to maintain them so that they last as long as possible.

TITLE:  I want to dye my hair?
BODY: I never do anything with my hair. It's probably 2 inches past my shoulder and just my boring natural color which is brown. I just want to do something new. I've tried just getting a cool cut like a bob, but everywhere I've gone they don't do it to where it looks good. Now I'm goring out my hair and I want to dye it. Probably not the whole thing, but maybe the underneath blue. I know that's weird but I love blue and I just wanna do something. Yolo. But, I'm scared that it'll look bad. I don't know. What should I do??
