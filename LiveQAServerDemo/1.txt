TITLE:  Ways to get cigarette smell out of apartment?
BODY: Basically, it reeks. When we checked it out before moving in the air wasn't and hadn't been on for a little while, so it smelled musty and masked it quite a bit. Now that we've been here for a while, it's becoming very noticeable. I'm embarrassed when I go to work because the smell of my clothes makes it seem like I smoke more than a chimney despite never touching a cigarette. We cleaned the carpets with a vacuum meant for things like this, but there's no difference in the smell. It's driving me crazy. I'm going to try cleaning the walls, cabinets, and floors again, but wanted to see if anyone else had an idea or two.

TITLE:  13 year old girl, wanna lose weight by December? Questions?
BODY: Quick overview here- I'm a 13 year old girl, 140 pounds and.. I think 5'4? Last I checked 165cm so idk feet. Alright, for me it's not about 'being thin, and pretty.' I tore my ACL completely in February skiing, and surgery will be around December. Then 6 months full recovery, and once I'm fully healed and a okay, I want to start kick boxing. Like, REALLY wanna start kick boxing. It's a great stress reliever, burns fat, builds muscle, teaches defense AND offence. Everything I need.

So I have a few questions about losing weight before December-

I'd hope to lose MAYBE 15-20 pounds by then, but I doubt it. I can't do high intensity exercises. How can I lose 15-20 pounds by December if I tried really hard, but keep in mind my torn ACL? Meaning no jumping, running, jogging etc. Elliptical is okay.

How many calories should I consume and eat? Now I've heard if you want to lose weight, you burn what you eat. And then burn more. So if you eat 1500 calories a day, you'd burn 3000 calories a day. I call BS on that. It's difficult getting to 300, let alone 3000? Is this true? 

And last but not least (this isn't fitness related, just a random question.) Do guys my age like skiny girls? Or chubby? or what? Im just curious, as this girl in my class has a flat stomach but really chubby legs, I'm just confused. Me, I'm slightly chubby around my stomach and thighs, but its not that hard to hide. Is that a look guys like?

Thank you!!
