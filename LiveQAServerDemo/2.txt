TITLE:  What materials and do I need to secure a 25' pole to 1/4 guy wires and at what angle and distance?
BODY: Using a 25' telephone pole in an art installation.

Can only dig 3 feet, using four 1/4" guy wires:
At what height should I secure the eye bolts?
What size eye bolts?
What size earth anchors?
What is the minimum distance from the pole that the earth anchors can be dug in?

This installation is not meant to be weight bearing BUT it is for Burning Man and I have to prepare for some dumbass to try and climb it.

Thanks

BODY: So, I have this old desktop windows 7 which I am trying to connect to my wifi, I have a Belkin wireless USB adapter but I lost the installation disk for it. I know I can download it only but I have to way to log online lol.... So I tried everything on my desktop settings to set up new network and all of that but I can't seem to get it. It was working a few hours ago before I reset the desktop to factory settings. Big mistake I guess but it used to have too many programs I didn't need. 

My question is how do I go about this? :(

TITLE:  Is it healthy to take peptol bismol everyday?
BODY: In about a week cross country practice will be starting for me and I was wondering if taking peptol bismol 2 times a day is bad for my health. Every time I go running I always have to go to the bathroom afterwords (#2). I'm just worried that the peptol bismol will impact my bowels in a negative way since practice is 2 times a day, every day. 

Also, if you know a way to prevent the need to take the peptol bismol, that would be great. I hate the flavor of it, the flavor sometimes goes as far as making me want to throw up. 

Thanks in advance

TITLE:  How likely is it that I will have to shave my head?
BODY: I am pretty sure I have squamous cell carcinoma on my scalp because I have 3-4 dark, squishy spots on my scalp and some of them are really sore and feel like a bad sunburn. One of the spots is always flakey and has been like that for over a month. All the skin down the center of my scalp where my hair parts is patchy and red. Some of the hair that grows out of it is 3x as thick as my normal hair and a totally different texture. I am seeing s doctor that specializes in skin cancer next week but I want to emotionally prepare for the worst. 

If anyone out there is familiar with skin cancer treatment, what is the likelihood that I will have to shave my head? Does hair grow back after they have removed the damaged skin?

TITLE:  Why Did My Rabbit not Like Me?
BODY: This is hard to write, so only serious answers will be appreciated.

I bought a new 3-month year-old bunny last week. It was a girl, and she was the sweetest thing. The moment I got her home, she was already licking my hand. I heard that when a bunny licks you, it's grooming you and loves you. I was weary at first to get a female bunny because I read they are much more territorial and moody. But she was great.

Two days later, I come to her cage to say hello, and she lunged at my hand. She was also more squirmy and fussy when I attempted to pick her up. I understand some bunnies don't like being picked up, but she did before.

If Bunnies have the same emotions as humans (some people told me), why was she acting like this? I hate rejection, and because she squirmed I ended up hitting her in the face- multiple times. She screamed (rare for a bunny), and I also noticed blood. I hit her a few- but causing blood? Is it because she was so young.

She ended up passing the next day. I am not sure if it was because I beat her up. After hitting her and also chasing her, when I picked her up she felt loose, wobbly and there was poop coming out of her butt.

Please - I am so hurt this happened. Why did she change on me like that? And why did she pass away?

TITLE:  8 Month Old Nose Ring Pussing?
BODY: Okay so I got my nose pierced in December and currently it is August. I've had no problem with it, always cleaned and washed it like how I was supposed to with dial soap and non iodized sea salt. In the past maybe 3 months its accidentally come out twice. The second time, which was a couple weeks ago, it bled a little. Not too concerned, I shoved it back in. Then I got a hoop, so I took my stud out. It bled when I took it out again. I didn't put the hoop in, afraid. Today, while I was absently playing with it, a small bubble of white milky stuff oozed from it, as if I had popped a white head. Is this normal? If not, what should I do? There are no keloids and it doesn't hurt.

TITLE:  Weird command prompt behavior on laptop?
BODY: I have a Dell Inspiron 3531, currently running Windows 8.1.

I ve first noticed this thing awhile back where command prompt would open and close automatically at random times. Sometimes it would open and close once with nothing written on it, but sometimes it would open again but this time with a bunch of writing and close by itself.

This has been continuing to happen to this day; in fact, I ve just witnessed it again today.

I have ran a virus check before and have done it again just before writing this inquiry. It detected nothing.

What is this issue, and is anyone experiencing the same thing? Nothing bad as happened to my laptop, but should I be worried?

TITLE:  PC Crashing or CPU overheating?
BODY: Hi! I have just recently built a PC. My specs are a XFX R9 280, 12GB's of RAM, AMD FX-8350, Gigabyte GA-970A-D3P Motherboard, 500w PSU, and a BitFenix Comrade Mid Tower ATX Case. Just recently it has started freezing while in any game after an hour or so, I go to feel the top of the case (which is where my CPU is near and a exhaust fan) and it is extremely hot. So I stopped using it for about a week and put in a stronger exhaust fan and 2 120mm intake fans at the front of the case and it still freezes. I have a feeling it is the CPU. I tested the temps while idle (with Skype open) and the temps were 60°C at idle. While I was playing a game I went to go check my temps and they were 72°C and kept on playing and it froze. I felt the top of my case again and it was blistering hot. I've heard that I should get a after market cooler like a Hyper 212 Evo but I don't know if it is the CPU for sure. Please help!

TITLE:  Any advice I can get for starting a BL/High Fantasy comic?
BODY: I'm wanting to start a BL/high fantasy comic based on my Pathfinder setting Estion.

The protagonist is a young tailor who aspires to become a mage, and sets out to achieve that goal after getting permission from his liege.

Along the way, he ends up in a romance affair with a fellow adventurer, a knight.

I've never done anything like this before. I've run pathfinder games, I've written stories for those games, but I've never done it like this. I've never written any sort of romance story.

This was kind of a random thought that crossed my mind a couple weeks ago, told myself I wouldn't try it unless I still wanted to later.

How should I proceed, though? I want to improve my art before I start, which is why I started that thread in arts and crafts. But I'm more looking for story advice right now. 

How much should I focus on the high fantasy aspect?
The romance aspect?

For reference I drink like 300 to 600ml of water per hour on average and maximum would be 1.5 liters/hour. And yeah I do pee every hour also. That's just my water intake since I was a child. But just want to know an answer.

I have this feeling in my stomach where I feel ravanous but can only eat a little even though I feel hungry. Also my head feels like there is pressure in it. Not painful but also not normal. I have anxiety and get panic attacks, but this has been happening for the whole week and I really think something is wrong. I had blood work done yesterday and I'm going to the doctor again tomorrow....in the mean time I'm freaking out! What's wrong with me?

For other programs it also shows just those two icons (still oversized) against a black background without any words (sorry I couldn't upload a picture of this.
