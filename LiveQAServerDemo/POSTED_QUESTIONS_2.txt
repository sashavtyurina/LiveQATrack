TITLE:  Hair problem?
BODY: I have had this problem for as long as I remember. Every time my hair gets wet it gets really poofy and hairs stick out everywhere. Due to this, I cant really take showers and go do what I have to do right after like most people do.The only way I have found to deal with this is to wear a beanie for a couple of minutes to calm it down. There has to be another solution to end this for good, anybody know how I can deal with this?

TITLE:  Does the palate expander change anything other than the teeth?
BODY: So last week I got a palate expander apparently to make space for two teeth that weren't able to come out and actually they are now noticable through my gum and it looks like they wanna come down (which is a good thing).... Anyways I was just wondering will this make any changes other than bringing the teeth down ? will it change the way I look? will it make my nose look bigger ? Will it make my jaw line more defined or less defined ? Will it make my face slimmer ?

TITLE:  Eye Surgery?
BODY: I want to get surgery to change my eyes from brown to blue. I am black male and I would love to have blue eyes. As if they arent rare enough imagine that a black man with blue eyes. I will make sure that there has been tests done regarding side effects and all that but I wanted to know what people think. I don't currently know of any surgerys that can perform this aside from stroma and they are not operating in the U.S.A as of right now because they want to make sure that everything is safe regarding side effects. Now to why I am posting this. If I did go through with this what would I tell my parents??? or to a potential girl I met because I obviously can't lie say if one day I have kids and their eyes are brown.

But I have to handle it everyday and it's not easy, it tangles like Crazy... I wonder if there is a way to straighten it maybe for the occasion not for permanent or with frequency. I wish she could have a bang for just one day...Also, if there are any blasians or parents of blasians here, let me know if there are any hair tips I can use or I can tell her in the future. 

Thanks :)

TITLE:  Gum Infection or what?
BODY: Okay, so idk how to explain it so i'll try my best without trying to sound crazy or whatever.

So last Friday i got a molar extracted. I have no pain or anything at all. but about two days ago the side of my gum like where my tongue touches it stings or burns idk how to describe it. It's kinda like, have you ever had the roof of your mouth burn or bleed a little because you were sucking on something too hard or you ate something that was hot and burned the roof of your mouth? yes no idk? anyway that feeling is on my gums, and its just one part of my gum where my tooth was extracted. I looked in the mirror and everything look normal i know i dont have dry socket becuse there's ni pain at all. it just stings or something when my tongue touches it slightly or anything slightly touched it.  
I called my dentist and I have a appointment next Tuesday but I was just wondering if anyone may know what it is and what I can do to make it not such a problem until my appointment.

(my aunt suggested that its probably a sore or cut, and someone suggested that I rinse my mouth with listerine to kill any bacteria but I haven't done that because idk if its safe just after a tooth extraction and I thought the listerine may make it sting even more. 

Anyway I explained as much as I can, hope it makes sense.

TITLE:  Why was Michael Jordan able to win 6 titles with significantly less talent than what Larry Birdman had only won three titles?
BODY: Bird has 6 HOFers on his team.

MJ only had two HOF. Pippen and Rodman.
That's it. Yet MJ dominated a tougher era that wasn't as physical as the 80's, but was CLOSE to the physicality of the 80's. Besides, MJ dominated the 80's as an individual and maybe his team never did but that's only because he had BUMS on his squad.

Give MJ all of the HOFers BIRD had and MJ wins the Finals every single year.

Just saying.

The 86 Celtics are so overrated. Tired of hearing about how great they are.

TITLE:  What lip balms/moisturizers would you recommend?
BODY: My son had been using eos pomegranate raspberry, and recently all of a sudden, his lips have been really chapped and dry and have been peeling a little bit. He kept putting the eos on them, but it wasn't helping at all, so we're thinking it could be that the product is no longer working on his lips. Since then today, he started putting aquaphor in his lips to help his lips heal up from the dryness, chappiness, and peeling. He is considering going back to using the chapstick brand lip balm like he is before, but based on stuff he read today about it, he saw that chapstick isn't as great to use as he thought it was. With that said, what lip balls/moisturizers would y'all recommend for him to use that won't require him to have to apply it alot throughout the day and that won't dry out, peel, or make his lips chapped? He doesn't wanna spend a whole bunch of money, so he's looking for something affordable and effective to use that has the right stuff in it to keep his lips moisturized and that doesn't have ingredients that'll make his lips worse.

Sometimes she will walk around the house but not often. She doesn't play with any toys at all and the only time she ever seems active is when she goes outside. She is very friendly and cuddly but she is very boring to lay with. Is there anything I can do and is this normal?

TITLE:  Wisdom Tooth Removal at 15?
BODY: My dentist took an X-ray of my wisdom teeth, and all four of my wisdom teeth are growing at an inwards angle. She recommended to have them cut out right now, when I m 15. I ve read that at 15, inside only the root of the tooth has formed, and the whole tooth grows until you re 18. Is it really necessary to cut the gum to get the wisdom root/tooth removed? Or is it better to wait till 18 when they come out, and then just pull them out? Has anybody had this experience? It seems like it s better for the orthodontist to do surgery because it s more expensive than if you just pull them out.

TITLE:  14 years old and my hair falls out more than average?
BODY: I'm a 14 year old girl. For the past 2 years I want to say my hair has been falling out more than normal. Around 2 years ago I suffered from trichotillomania, a disorder where I was obsessed with pulling out my own hair. Thankfully, I recovered. 
Ever since I suffered from that, my hair has significantly thinned and I've began shedding. It falls out in clumps, and my friends have noticed.
Recently, my friends and I tried to dye everyone's hair a different color. Mine didn't work, and the dye was supposedly very gentle on the hair. When we were rinsing it out, my friend noticed the amount of strands I was losing, and I actually ended up clogging their bathroom sink.
It's summer, so it isn't stress. I struggle with anorexia though I am trying to recover on my own. I also don't style my hair in any way, and it's naturally curly/wavy (mostly wavy). I also brush it very little, only before a shower.

TITLE:  How do I convince my mom to take my cat to the vet?
BODY: My cat has barely ate anything since Monday (it was Wednesday night when I wrote this) and keeps sneezing constantly and has a fever (I looked up how to check it) and has been snuggled up in his cat bed and barely moved since Monday. She keeps telling me we will see how he is tomorrow even though I found a free one. I am worried about my cat and want to get him better as soon as possible. How can I get her to take him to a vet?

TITLE:  I messed up my bangs very bad (please help!)?
BODY: I'm am such a ******* idiot. My bangs were really long and it was getting annoying and I wanted to just cut a little bit off. I was pissed before I did it about something and wasn't thinking..I should have asked my mom to do it. 
Now by bangs are all messed up. There so short, I can't even put it behind my ear! And just plain wrong.
Please, anyone, tell me how to grow it back REALLY FAST. 

I heard massaging your hair helps and massaging it with olive oil.

Any tips?
I have curly hair so I have to straighten it so it looks less dumb. 

I need to grow it fast before my mom notices. Please help.

TITLE:  Braces with elastics/rubber band pain?
BODY: Backstory:
I am currently 14 1/2, I got my braces when I was 9. I got them off the following year (I was in 4th grade by that time). At that time, I got a retainer, which I had until I got brace again at the beginning of 6th grade, making me 11 at that point. Okay, skipping up to today, I ve had this going on for 5 years, including having 2 baby teeth and 4 adult teeth removed to make room in my mouth, and also lazer surgery on my gums. I moved to another state and got a new orthodontist where they had me use rubber bands for the first time. At first it hurt a bit, but it was just normal discomfort, but it was fine. After a few months, they went to a smaller kind of rubber bands, and I couldn t wear them half the day without feeling nauseas and tried multiple times to be able to wear them but I just couldn t, and the next time I went, they gave me back the original ones. Anyways, it is now a couple months later and I still can t wear the old ones for a full day without crying and having my entire head hurt, and I m not sure what to do. My mom wants to get a new orthodontist, is that a good idea?

TITLE:  Dying bleached blonde hair to black?
BODY: Hi! 
My natural hair color is brown.. I dyed it to a black- really black. After over a year with black hair, I wanted a change so I went to a professional hair salon and wanted an ombre look for the summer... I told my hair stylist to open up my hair as much as possible without damaging it. She opened it up to a chocolate brown and told me that I would have to go by her one more time to really open up the color. So, I waited a month then returned to her. She bleached my hair once again using Olaplex (Treatment to not damage hair when bleaching).. My hair opened up to a lighter color but after a few washes, the color started fading and got brassy! It now looks more on the orange tone and I am not a fan of it! + I think I look much better with dark hair. 

How can I dye my hair back to black safely, at home?
I did some research and read that I would have to first dye it a dark brown then to a black to avoid "green or gray" color tones.. 
Can't I just use a Black box hair dye?


I do not want to go to a "professional" salon because I already did that with the lightening process and feel like it was a waste of my $300 :( 


Thanks so much for your time :))

TITLE:  Will the orange in my hair fade after dying it?
BODY: Two days ago I went to my stylist to dye my hair, I had my natural light ash brown hair and asked for a light golden blonde hair (very much like Hermione Granger to be honest, she was my reference lol). The strand of hair in the chart was about right and it was a 9.3 'Very Light Blonde Golden' from the brand Tec Italy so I wouldn't think anything would go wrong, also after seeing the dye looked light yellow-ish. But when it was applied to my hair it started looking orange. The result was a very light copper blonde/golden hair... not really blonde. Now, I learned how stylists use colors to cancel out others with a color wheel, so was the green from my ashy hair painted with a orange/red and that's why it looks that way or something like that? Will it fade out eventually and look like I wanted it, not orange at all? Or should I not bother and dye my hair again? 

The thing is, I want it golden blonde in a few weeks for an event. So it's a time thing and I don't wanna bleach it.

Any help would be great. Thank you so much for reading.

TITLE:  Can overbites be serious?
BODY: Just a few days ago My Orthadontist discovered I had an overbite. I m 13 and my mom said she never noticed. Later I asked what an overbite was but my mom said I didn t need braces beacuse it wasn t serious, though my orthodontist recommend it. I asked my mom if I should get them and she said no you didn t even know you had one. I actually did, but I thought everyone had it. I asked my friend to see her smile and it looked nothing like mine. She said mine was bad. I want to know what an overbite can do if untreated at a young age and how do I know if is serious. I want to know if later it can cause serious unfixable problems after my jaw fully developed.

TITLE:  Teeth don't align?
BODY: So I woke up a day or so ago and when I went to close my mouth something didn't feel right; so I went to the mirror. It showed that my bottom two teeth didn't align with my two front; meaning the tooth on the right (My Right) would go behind the gap I have between my two front teeth. My lower line of teeth are more set to the right. I feel like it has something to do with me always sleeping on my left side and that's what made then go uneven and I don't think braces would even fix them because my teeth aren't bent or cracked their just...uneven! I'm sure it has something to do with my jaw, so I was wondering if I should just lay on my right side to try to even them out but I'm not sure. So please help because it is REALLY uncomfortable.

When I first got my desktop I plugged it in with a VGA cable to my monitor (it wouldn't work a DVI cable) When I installed my GTX 650 it still used a VGA cable. However when I installed EVGA 500W power supply it would not work with VGA or DVI cables. The only inputs that I have with my desktop is a mini HDMI, VGA, and DVI. And the only inputs I have on my monitor are the vga, dvi, and hdmi. I tried a VGA to DVI adapter and that didnt work. Should I try and get a mini hdmi to hdmi cable?

BODY: I used to live in a house with 3 cats, but only one was mine. In this house, my cat was fairly reclusive, and did not like to be pet. She was not very playful and constantly tried to go outside.

Now that we have moved, she is the only cat. She is very loving, and friendly, but gets withdrawn when there is company. She never tries to go outside and is playful like a kitten.

Did she just not like other cats before? I was hoping to get another kitten, because before we moved she used to love to bathe and care for the kitten my sister had, so I wanted to get her another baby, but If she doesn t seem to like them, should I not get one?

TITLE:  I'm getting a cavity filling tomorrow, please help!?
BODY: I'm getting a cavity filling tomorrow around 1:30 pm, here's the problem, I've never gotten a cavity filling. About a week ago, I went to the dentist with my father (I'm only 14) to get my teeth cleaned (I was also with my brother) once they called my name, I sat on the chair where I wait, as they took x-Rays of my mouth. then this doctor came in to check my teeth, she told me I have 2 cavities on 2 teeth on the bottom back of my mouth, obviously I was nervous about this, cause I was scared (I have a fear of the dentist) then a dentist came in and saw my cavities, she told me I needed a filling, I was scared because I didn't know what kind of filling she meant, she told me that I could get one at that moment, but since I didn't knew what a cavity filling was I got nervous and started crying because I HATE needles and she said the shot only hurt like a little pinch, and I was nervous again because I hate needles and I hate any kind of feelings of getting shots, she said the numbing shot wouldn't work because I was nervous and crying so I had to make another appointment so my dad did, now I'm going tomorrow, and I've done some research on cavity fillings and I know about numbing gel. but I'm still a bit scared, any advice to help me stay calm? thanks! &lt;3

TITLE:  Which agency do you think should lead the response to an event like 9/11? Why would you choose the agency for this task?
BODY: So I'm doing a discussion on the emergency response during the 9/11 attacks. Looking back at how things were handled, and reading "The 9/11 Commission Report"I found that there were many things that could have been done to prevent the attacks from happening and possibly killing or capturing Bin Laden early on. The report brings to light that the Pentagon did nothing when terrorists bombed the USS Cole on October 12, 2000, causing 17 sailors to lose their lives. Maybe, just maybe, if the Pentagon reacted - 9/11 might never had happened.

TITLE:  Cat is constantly licking around her mouth?
BODY: It's 2 in the morning (obviously for central time) and I walk into the hall and I see her standing there licking around her mouth alot. I panicked and thought she was choking so I walked up and started rubbing on her neck lightly (I'm not sure if that was for dogs or cats) but after that she started acting normal again. I lightly rubbed again to be sure (If I'm doing something wrong and or stupid please tell me.) And there was a bump on her throat-neck area. Is there something wrong? Or... Is she fine?

Now time has passed i can afford to get it removed. I went to visit my orthodontist and he said he needs to start all over again, and he wants me to start a new plan. I had already paid off in full of my original plan which cost like 4 grand, and i paid it off already, and now he wants me to start another one, his excuse was that a lot of things change in a course of 2 years and he has to start all over again, and this time i have to pay 5 grand if i want to get my teeth straightened.  Now i am stuck with these braces that they refuse to work on, I'm in California, so what kind of actions i can or should i take.

TITLE:  Why can't people accept that Michael Jordan was in fact, a basketball GOD?
BODY: You have users like Maverick and Lakers for a 3-peat on this site who are so stupid and deny MJ's greatness. MJ was like the Jesus Christ of basketball. No, I don't say that to be funny or to troll or anything. I really mean it. His accomplishments are insane.

6-time NBA champion.
6-time NBA Finals MVP.
10 Scoring Titles.
1 DPOY award
Need I go on?

Name any other player who comes CLOSE to his accomplishments that played in the modern era 1980-present?

NOBODY. This guy was a basketball genius, a God.

Oh and for Lakers for a 3-peat guy: Michael Jordan DOMINATED the 1991 Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. He SWEPT the Pistons. So what were you saying about MJ not being able to dominate 80's teams? He destroyed the very team (which still had Isiah and Lambeer and many of their players in THEIR PRIMES) which beat the 1989 Lakers. So you were saying? MJ swept the vaunted Bad Boy Pistons.

I'm the only person on this site who knows anything about basketball.

Bunch of dummies.

BODY: I my two small dogs have begun using my 2nd floor apt. patio to urinate, etc. on.  Not knowing what to do at the moment I witnessed this, I grabbed a bag of kitty litter and shook it around the area of the patio they were using.  The next time they went out the went to the kitty litter to do 'their business'.  I'm willing to attempt to train them to use a kitty litter box but I'm wondering if the litter is bad for the dogs? I've tried the pellets made from recycled paper but the dogs won't have anything to do with that. Of course they are both over 6 years old now and were trained when I had a real back yard. I have to find something for them to use on the patio because the smell is so hideous and I'm worried my neighbors will begin smelling it soon.

BODY: I have really oily skin , and a couple of red spots/ scars from acne. I'm using Tarte foundation which works really great on getting me not to shine but it doesn't cover the red spots very well. Any recommendations on a good foundation that will cover up the redness and keep me shine free ?

TITLE:  Are these stanzas too dense?
BODY: I awoke early on resurrection morn;
	A sound had lulled my soul from rest,
	My soul from sleep did music wrest.
With an angel were the skies adorned;
She had trumpeted her golden horn!
       Yet her quaver played from heaven’s crest,
        Had only been a trumpet’s test!
Ah - I arose too early on this gloried morn.

There was no sight, nor pangs of Earthly sin; 
        For in the flames of horn-filled hell,
        The Tempter was condemned to dwell.
Stelliferous the skies, yet the morn was dim,
As a wicked host was cast down by Him; 
	The morning star – to Earth it fell,
        (And the stars - those third – came down as well.)
With cacophony and din.

I remembered - before I slept, before I rose,
	I inquired at her grave with grief:
	O! To Death that rules beneath,
Will she live beyond your throes?
My Faith had been a dying rose;
	Encroached with deadened, withered leaves,
	And the wretched thorns of unbelief.
(As the One I prayed to surely knows.)

What does this mean? Also I've been seeing a lot of 'floaters' in my left eye. Some are black dots, some are black dots with white surrounding them and others are like white lightening bolts. I mentioned it to my optician who is booking me for a test. What does all this mean?

Kind regards bex

BODY: so basically yesterday i went to the dentist and got my spacers on, something you get before braces. The dentist told me they wouldnt hurt that bad but he lied. My teeth hurt worse than it did when i fractured my hand, which may seen iver dramatic but its not!
i cant bite down on anything hard, i tried sucking on ice but that hurts when i take a deep breath it makes my teeth hurt and when im not even moving my mouth my teeth tend to hurt! i have no clue what to do or eat because my sister had a retainer instead of spacers before she got braces and my dad doesnt remember what it was like! im asking a few friends about it but they arent really helping out! please help because i really want to eat some food because ive been eating very small poportions because my teeth hurt so badly!! thank you.

TITLE:  Dreadlocks/Short hair/Extensions?
BODY: Hi,

I have shortish (just about shoulder length) hair. Iv wanted dreads for years and my hair isn't growing at all. Sigh! 
I do however have a ton of on the weft extensions. Would I be able to make them into dreads and then somehow put them into my hair? 
The only problem is that my hair is SUPER thin (From far to many glue extensions) and if I have to dread my hair first I'm probably only going to have like 10 dreads. I was alot of them haha.
I have had a look on YouTube and can't really find a very well explained way of putting them in, especially when you have fine hair.
If anyone has any information that would be awesome.
Or you actually dread hair an put in dread extensions local to Birmingham or south Wales that would be AWESOME! 

Thankyouuuuuuu :)

Like I had malaria  Or something I took some malaria tablets day before yesterday at night and I became very dizzy I went to bed usual time and woke up feeling really weak so I went back to bed when I woke up the second time the top of both my eyes began to feel ticklish not really ticklish but a very weird feeling, ,since then my visions has been a but uncomfortable where the is a direct source of light facing my eye, like when I look at my phone or TV, especially at night or maybe if someone is standing in front  of the widow I cant really see, but I can read well, small and big letters, it only happens  when even a little light riches my eyes. Like for example the lights on the keyboard or my cell phone are a bit blurry,,,,and the feel a bit heavy ,no head ache or anything just one twitch feeling in my eye it is in both eyes but I think the left is more noticeable, just in case this is related to diabetes ,yes my family has a history but the last time I check my sugar level was 70-75 ,16 year old male by the way ,no fatigue, no over stress,i don't really drink much water, ,don't really eat much either, ,I will tell my parents and see a doctor just want to know if it may be serious so that at least I can prepare for it PS I'm always busy with  my phone and computer .thanks

TITLE:  Overwhelmed with my new kitten?
BODY: I just got a 11 week year old kitten 3 days ago and I'm feeling overwhelmed!!! My friends with cats say that the feeling will pass away in about a month but I'm not sure. Caring for them is easy, but I didn't know he would be so hyper all the time. My mom doesn't want him going on the couch, so does anyone have any suggestions about that? He's in my basement, but I wanna get him used to my house and I don't know how. I feel like I shouldn't have gotten a pet, but I don't have the heart to give him back. Please help me and try to answer all my questions.
-Thanks

TITLE:  Any advice on my kitten not being a good eater?
BODY: I have had him a month - he is about 12 weeks old.
He is not unhealthy, he's not starving or wasting away or anything like that.
But he is not a very good eater - more food goes in the bin than in him.
I keep trying all different variations of kitten food - dry, pouches - meat in gravy, meat in jelly, fish as good as it looks, fish in jelly.  I've  tried shops own brand too.

He hardly eats anything and I can't figure out what his preference is.

(he eats plenty of snacks and scraps and chew sticks and slices of cold meat so he is not in danger, but I want him to eat kitten food).

TITLE:  Why isn't my monitor turning on?
BODY: I have the Acer S231Hl monitor and it has a problem. When I plug it in the monitor doesn't turn on. I know it has power running through it because the power button lights up blue, but the screen doesn't show anything. It is pitch black like it isn't on. I don't have a warranty either. This happened about a year ago I was about to throw it away but changed my mind because it is in good condition I just want to fix it. I honestly don't know how it broke. I came home one day and I saw that I couldn't turn it on. I used to use it to play games on it. So I guess i over used it

Were they reading all the time or were the people just doing it on occasion, The reason i ask is that i see in movies the libraries they had and they were in their study so how did they study. I know books were limited before print but they read carefully or just took their time?

I was flamed by many on this Q&amp;A site for even suggesting that LA may go to LA or SA. Well the word this morning is that he has decided to leave the Blazers and is looking hard at the Lakers. Are Portland fans still in denial or are you finally seeing that players do get tired of losing?

TITLE:  Why the hell do historians keep insisting the American Civil War is the first modern war, but not World War I?
BODY: I can never get the argument behind this.
Most of the reasons cited are summed up as being mainly due to 
rapid-fire weps, steam ships, aerial observation and telegraphs. But that's pretty much it.   

Now compare this at WWI. There were:

The first EVER tank, first ever armored warfare

The first EVER plane uses, first ever aerial warfare

The first ever full use of gas warfare

Dreadnoughts

Widespread use of submarines and U-Boats

Zeppelins

Long Distance angled-aiming artillery guns

The first ever practical hand grenades

The first modern flamethrower

The first LMG

The first ever SMG

The first ever anti-aircraft guns

The first ever anti-tank guns

Gas masks

First ever full usage of camouflage for uniforms

First ever full usage of helmets

And even a re-introduction of body armor  


And historians don't call it a "modern war"? WWI definitely looks like the one war which completely shaped the 20th century. How is everyone missing this?!

Is it the brand that I bought that my cat doesn't like or what?

Also my cat isn't shy with me anymore but I encourage it to go outside but I wont even take a step what should I do?

BODY: I bleached my hair and it turned yellowish gold and I'm trying to get it to white, so I bought Blond brilliance golden toner. I did more research and it looks like I'll need a purple one for it to actually turn white. I don't really understand how toners work, is golden not as strong as the purple one? I live kinda far from Sallys so I'm trying to figure out a way to get this one to work so i don't have to drive there to return it and buy a different one. My roots bleached white but most of it is still that yellow color. Also, can you give me any tips on how to get white (Ive tried it before and it didn't work)? Thanks in advance!

TITLE:  How do /you/ interpret this poem?
BODY: A Hymn To God The Father

Hear me, O God! 
A broken heart 
Is my best part. 
Use still thy rod, 
That I may prove 
Therein thy Love. 

If thou hadst not 
Been stern to me, 
But left me free, 
I had forgot 
Myself and thee. 

For sin's so sweet, 
As minds ill-bent 
Rarely repent, 
Until they meet 
Their punishment. 

Who more can crave 
Than thou hast done? 
That gav'st a Son, 
To free a slave, 
First made of nought; 
With all since bought. 

Sin, Death, and Hell 
His glorious name 
Quite overcame, 
Yet I rebel 
And slight the same. 

But I'll come in 
Before my loss 
Me farther toss, 
As sure to win 
Under His cross.

--Ben Johnson

[...]

I came across this poem in my literature textbook &amp; am not sure what to take from it. . . .

Is the writer battling himself against the temptations of supposed sin? Does he even /believe/ in a god or higher power? My thoughts.

TITLE:  How do I get my kitties to get along?
BODY: So my friends has a neighbor who has a litter of wild kittens in his yard. Me and two of my friends caught some of them and took them to her house and bathed and fed them. They were all very stressed and scared and they hissed a lot but anyways I started to bond with one and took her home. It took her a couple days to get used to me but once she warmed up, she was the sweetest thing. Then yesterday I went back to my friends house bc we were taking out cats to the vet together. When I got there they had caught another kitten This cat apparently already had a home, but the people decided they didn't want it so I volunteered to foster it until it found another home. But anyways while we were at the vet, we put all the kitties in the same cage and my first kitten (her name is Athena) was growling at all the other kittens the whole time. Then after the vet we went back to my friends house with all the kittens and Athena wouldn't stop hissing and meowing and scratching the other cats. When I got back to my house with Athena and ed, ed being the other cat bc he is a ginger and looks like Ed sheeran who I love, Athena kept hissing at Ed and then she even started growling and hissing and biting and scratching me. I feel like she hates me bc of this new cat, who is sooo sweet and doesn't even mess with Athena. I just want Athena to stop being so mean and to get along with Ed and other cats in general, so any help on what to do? And these cats are still a little feral.

 And loping? WHAT am I going to do about that?! 
Should I chair sit? 
What is the correct position for bareback riding?

TITLE:  What should I do if my cat scratches or bites me?
BODY: I was petting my cat recently and she was being sweet and purring. When I was reaching to scratch her ear, (I think she thought I was going to touch her belly, which she doesn t like) she scratched me. It wasn t too hard, but she got my eyelid and it hurt. Involuntarily, I screamed out in pain/surprise/anger and she ran away.  I should probably be more clear about avoiding her belly in the future. She came back like 10 min later and rubbed up against me. She s now napping next to me so I can t have scared her too much. I just feel so bad that I yelled. I usually try to avoid it. If she scratched me again, what is a good way to tell her to stop?

BODY: Boehner is weak between the ears. USA is now in a leadership vacuum..

We are now gyrating downwards to becoming a 3rd or even a 4th World country. My recommendation would be to ushering in a guy like the Trajan and Hadrian combo to resurrecting this fallen country.

The History Books tell us that Hadrian is a great general, statesman, strategic and tactical war fighter, strong administrator, wise, architect, poet, civil engineer. 

Let us hope this day in Bethlehem unto us will be born a Savior like Hadrian.

TITLE:  Why is my tooth sensitive to the cold?
BODY: Im usually super good with my teeth and it's been years since I had a cavity. Well when I went last week I had four (on the bottom, 2 on each side on the very back teeth). They filled them about 3 days ago and I noticed that my very back tooth on the bottom left is really sensitive to the cold. I heard them mention that the cavities on the left is deeper but they filled it. So will it go away? If so when?

TITLE:  Is it possible to save a crack/ broke teeth?
BODY: I'm starting to think doctors are paid more or its less work for extractions. I was told having a root canal for a cracked tooth is not good because if I leave the tooth and there is no tooth under neath it it will keep pushing down to the gum and will cause problems. Does this make any sense? I think this place is a crooked office and think they just dont want to do the root canal I already lost 2 teeth when it could have been saved with root canal but I was younger and didn't understand this. How can I be certain that this teeth need to be removed?

TITLE:  I don't know what colour dye I should use on my hair?
BODY: I dyed my hair for the first time about 2 months ago. My natural hair colour is black (I have asian black hair) and the colour I used to dye it a dark brown colour was a light blonde dye. The result of it was that it turned my hair into a dark dark brown colour. I want to dye it again but into a lighter brown, however I don't want to use bleach. So what colour dye should I use on my hair?

I have purchased a light reddish brown colour dye. Will that make a difference on my hair?

BODY: I have an empty EOS Chapstick container, so I am going to refill it on my own with beeswax, etc. 
If I want to add colour in it without adding a lipstick, could I use food colouring, or would that stain my lips, say, blue? I don't want to waste my time making the Chapstick for it to leave my lips an ungodly navy colour, hehe. 
Also, I've seen some people add non-toxic crayons for colour. If I want to add a fun colour that wouldn't normally pass for a lipstick, like bright green, would the hue stain my lips as well, or...

TITLE:  Girls: Ideas?!!?
BODY: I broke up with my ex-boyfriend because he was a cheater (at least 3 times!) and verbal abuser. Anyway, I saw him recently at a party and he cornered me in a hallway. He started getting agitated and then said we “had to get back together.” I said “no” and started to walk away when he grabbed my arm and twisted. I broke free and kicked him as hard as I could right in the balls with my pointed cowgirl boots! After I rocked his babymakers, he fell down and puked while I stood over him and asked him if he could taste his nuts. His face was priceless!

I guess I nailed him so hard his nuts swelled up to the size of oranges and one ruptured and had to be removed (I play college soccer so I know how to blast a ballsack!). I feel a little bad about what happened but he is now saying he never mess with a girl again and he even wears an athletic cup all the time to protect his remaining family jewel.

My girlfriends on the soccer team now call me the "nut remover" and say I should hang up a fake pair of nuts like a hunting trophy on a tombstone background with the words "RIP Brian's Nuts-Destroyed By Girl Power” since I sent his nuts to “nut heaven.” Other people say I should hang up a guy's athletic cup as a symbol of female power over male weakness (guy’s nuts are so vulnerable and they need the extra protection). Any other good nicknames? And what should I hang up? The nuts? The cup? Both? The more names and ideas the better! Be creative! Just wish more girls could experience blasting a jerk’s balls! It is such a great feeling seeing a supposedly tough guy go down with one kick. Must suck to have nuts. They are just two targets dangling between a guy’s legs! One shot and it is all over.

TITLE:  How to tell family their house reeks of cat urine?
BODY: I recently went to visit close family and was knocked on my butt by the smell of cat urine when I walked in the door. After a few hours I'd developed a headache from the fumes. I did talk with them about it and also let them know I had to make other arrangements for a place to stay. They apologized and did some cleaning for a few days when I was there. I visited briefly before I left and the smell was still there and still strong. That makes me think this is a serious issue and requires more than just cleaning. They can't smell it and that makes me worry for their health (there's a small child at the house). What else can I do?

They condemn this flag because it represents slavery and our dark past, but they put Africa in front of America, the very same Country that captured, enslaved and sold their ancestors to America long, long before the Civil War.

BODY: I have a one year cat who I have had for about a year. I just got a new kitty who is 10 weeks old. They get along until the kitty starts running around and getting out of the one year old cats sight. When the kitty really starts moving or get out of his sight the older cat pounces on him. This many times leads to the older cat keep stalking the kitty and biting him. I'm worried that the older cat could hurt the young kitty.

TITLE:  Can I cover stretch marks with makeup and setting spray?
BODY: So I'm going on vacation soon and I just bought a new bikini. However, I'm moderately overweight (which I'm totally fine with) and as a result I've recently gotten these bright red stretch marks all across my belly and chest. I got a high rise bottom so that it covers up the ones on my belly but it's not quite high enough to cover the others without being pulled up constantly. So basically my question is if I use a moderate coat of foundation and spray it with Urban Decay setting spray will it be strong enough that I can get in the water and not have it wash away? Or should I just stick to tanning? Other methods of cover up are also appreciated!

TITLE:  Bum problems with kitten! please help!?
BODY: I brought my kitten home almost 2 weeks ago. He's just around 9 weeks old. Very active, playful, absolutely perfect. His name is Loki &amp; he's captured my heart --to say the least.
I've noticed, compared to my mums cats stools, Loki's are a little soft. &amp; he does NOT have diariah or seepage. But his anus is a little pink &amp; almost chapped looking. I've taken soft damp tissue &amp; wiped it as if his mama kitty would to help keep it clean.. In hopes that would help. 2 days of doing this for him, it's not as chapped looking but still mild inflamed almost, pink, if you will. We have him on kittens nutrition hard food &amp; he's eating &amp; drinking perfectly fine. 
Now, we still have not found a good vet, nor dewormed him. (That comes on Friday)
My questions are...
Is he not cleaning himself right?
Does he have worms?
Will deworming his little self help the issue?
I've read similar posts about the same symptoms &amp; the risk of the kittens ANUS FALLING OUT, OR TURNING INSIDE OUT?!
Should I worry about that? 
I am terrified for him!)':

Just wondering if anyone knows how well the colours would turn out, since my hair is pretty dark. My aim isn't to be super bold, but I also don't want it to be so subtle that people don't easily notice that my hair is pinkish-purplish, ya feelin' me?

TITLE:  This lady is trying to steal my friends kitten, what do we do?
BODY: Me and my friend are 17, and the last few weeks of school our other friend found baby kittens (probably a few days old) and couldnt take care of them, so he gave them away, my parents had this friend who was a vet, we asked if she could bring them back to health and take care of them till they are ready to be without a mommy cat (they didnt get to have their mothers milks) a few weeks go by and today was our third day trying to get my friends kitten back (btw, we asked if she can take care of four kittens and three of them died 💔 but my friends kitten was the only one who survived, my friend already named him but the lady grew attached to him and then "renamed" him and keeps calling herself momma and her boyfriend dadda, they are... around 40 years old) their home is very unsafe for the kittens, so many baby kittens died there recently (this lady takes in unwanted cats) my friends cat isnt even 8 weeks old yet and today she said this lady she works for grabbed them and went to get them fixed (sorry! forgot to metion she has two more my kittens) my friend didn t want his kitten to get fixed this young because he could possibly die but she yelled at us and kept making excuses and lying to us. I fear she already gave them away so he couldnt have his kitten or i fear his kitten is gonna get sick and die, shes already doing so many things bad to the kittens when they are too young, i heard she man-handled one kitten before. Please Help ,anyone.

BODY: Well, ombre is pretty in right now, plus I think its really pretty. I want to do my whole head (brunette, and then bleaching the bottoms) but my dad is SO mean, or overprotective,  im not sure what it would even fall under. But, he wont let me dye my hair with dye. So, how do i do all that with like, natural things?
(BTW my hair is dirty blonde, I think my natural hair matters, right?)

TITLE:  Can I go swimming in dyed hair?
BODY: So I got red highlights two days ago. It's a natural kind of red, and I didn't use bleach. (Btw I'm Chinese). I got it dyed in Shanghai, but they said that the color should fade to brown in 3 months. I'm planning to go swimming with a friend soon, and I was wondering if the chlorine would make my highlights fade faster... I'm sorry if there aren't enough details, please ask if you need more!

TITLE:  I'm seventeen and I don't know how to put on makeup...?
BODY: Honest to god. First time I wore make-up I was fifteen and I was going to the prom with an older boy. I had my cousin put it on and I thought I looked like a doll.

Second time was when I was sixteen and going to my own prom, and honestly, I gave up and got frustrated and just put on mascara which still looked funny.

I am beginning to think I just don't look good in make-up. I think my eyes are my most attractive feature (i'm wasian) but I always look like a prostitute/pirate/gypsy when I put on eyeliner. Is it possible I look better without make up? Or am I doing it wrong :/

My mom doesn't wear so no one ever taught me...any tips?

TITLE:  Are the Heat better off now without Lebron?
BODY: They pick up Justise Winslow. 

He looks like the real deal to me. He's big and athletic like Lebron but certainly has a better shot than Lebron did at the same age and is better defensively now than Lebron will ever be. 

He's also had better coaching and played (successfully) in big games. Lebron never played a big game in his life until he got to the Heat and he stills struggles under pressure.

Between me and her, we were able to get it back to displaying the full screen within the monitor, but the resolution is much lower than it's supposed to be. Any suggestions on how to restore it?

And i called a different store to try and get it and i was told they don't have my contact prescription in their records only my glasses and that i have to go back to get it. Getting to my point can they keep it from me?

I looked into a lot of salons for how much they do "foils" for and apparently that is lightening hair (????). But I heard that theres these things called "Toners" and "Developers" and to my understanding toners even out weird hair colors you can get from bleaching and developers lighten your hair. 
What should i do/use on my hair?

My dad doesn't want to pay the money to get him put down at the animal clinic, and he said one of his friends would be willing to shoot my cat. Me and my mom think it's a horrible idea and my mom is for sure gonna pay the vet to put down my cat the proper way. I was just wondering if it was legal to shoot animals like that instead of putting them down? because my dad's friend shot his dog when he was sick.

I have 6 teeth that need to be pulled and was referred out to an oral surgeon that same day. Well, the oral surgeon denied me service because they want $2300 up front before they will touch my teeth and I cannot pay it and they refused to accept payments. So tomorrow, I'm going to a different dentist for a consultation and to see what can be done. What I want to know is, if tomorrows dentist was able to contact the dentist from tuesday for copies of my xrays, will the dentist also share my insurance information or will I have to give them the info myself?

TITLE:  My cat won't stop stalking/attacking my other cat?
BODY: So, I had my first cat for maybe 2 years before my other cat was introduced to him. We found her in the woods behind our house, and we fed her because she was pregnant. She eventually gave birth, and we found the kittens homes, but decided to keep her because she was somewhat feral. She lived in our backyard/woods, and our other cat was fine with her. He was always outside with her, and never touched her. Then, we moved north. She now lives inside and has barely any desire to go out. He continues to go in the backyard when its warm, while she watches from inside. He absolutely hates her, but she loves him. Occasionally she'll clean him if she can get close enough, but the majority of the time he stalks her around the house and will attack her. She is capable of fighting back, she's much stronger, but she never does it. She's jumpy because she never knows where he is and when he'll attack. We've tried punishing him, for example, he hates water so we'll spray him, or put him in the bathroom for five minutes or so, but nothing is working. We're pretty sure its territorial- in our old house she had the patio and he had the house, she didn't ever set foot in the house. Now she's in his house constantly. We want them to get along, and are all out of ideas to try. Please help!

I also read that Himmler did not want to kill any Jewish children because he felt it was inhumane

TITLE:  Dental Insurance: Can I use my Parents Dental Insurance even though I am 26? And is it easy to repair a small crack in the Teeth Yourself?
BODY: Pretty self-explanatory. Looking to go into a Dental Appointment soon and just wanted to clarify a few things. I have a small crack in my tooth, nothing serious, but something I want to fix now while it is small, as well as a cleaning. As it stands, I am still hunting for Health and Dental Insurance, but while I know I can't use my parents Heath Insurance but am I allowed to use my Parents Dental Insurance Still?

Also, while I could go to the Dentist to get a small crack repaired, like all medical providers, they overcharge you for EVERYTHING these days, would it be easier to do it yourself with some bonding cream and the light? Appreciate the help.

TITLE:  Easiest way to go back blonde?
BODY: I made a mistake by bleaching and dying half my head purple (Melanie Martinez style) and I want to go back blonde before school starts up again so in like a couple months. My hair is very thin so it's not going to grow out fast enough for me to just grow it out and cut it off. The ideas that I had were to bleach my entire head and then dye it a natural blonde as close as I can to my natural color, or cut all my hair off and wait for it to grow. My question is if I were to do the first idea, how would I go about that? Like to get both sides exactly the same color.

TITLE:  Buying pellets from Amazon?
BODY: Can't find any websites that I can buy alfalfa pellets from and none of the feed stores around me sell them for some reason. Can't go out of town just yet to another feed store and I want to see if she will eat better with some alfalfa in her diet - she gets two flakes of Bermuda every day, three pounds of Integrity Senior with 1/4 apple cider vinegar and "free range" mineral salt.

I also thought of a Timothy/alfalfa pellet but she's never had Timothy before and I know for sure she loves alfalfa so will probably go with that.

I'm not sure about buying animal products from Amazon - random things like books or movies or electronics or whatever doesn't make me leery but not sure about Standlee pellets. 

If you don't recommend do you know a website or a feed store that will ship the pellets to Coachella Valley, CA?

Thank you!

TITLE:  Should i get braces?
BODY: All my teeth are straight. The biggest procedure I’ve ever had done is getting a baby tooth pulled (my first tooth came out a year after all the other kids and the rest were slow too, one never fell out so they pulled it). Other than that I’ve only ever had annual cleanings. The doctor says i have a super deep bite or something like that my front teeth almost touch my lower gums. Should i get braces for future dental work? If i don’t get them now will my teeth move in the future, assuming i get my wisdom teeth out in time? I don’t mind the braces i think they are cute actually and while they’d hurt picking bands would be fun, but i don’t want to have to wear a retainer it just seems so unnatural to have a chunk of plastic in your mouth!

TITLE:  How to clean after a mouse?
BODY: My cat brought me a live mouse and after he let it go, he began chasing it around my room. In the beginning, I was in my bed but then I felt something touch my leg and I saw that it was a baby mouse. I put my sheets, my pillows near my bed where the mice was, and my blanket in the laundry basket. Then it got under my mattress(I don't have a bed or anything to hold the mattress.) So I lifted it up and my cat killed it, there was no blood or anything missing. I picked it up and threw it in the trash. After that I replaced my sheets, my covers, and my blanket. I'm just wondering how do I disinfect my bed and the floor properly? Or if I don't need to and it's fine the way it is ?

TITLE:  How can I finally get rid of my split ends?
BODY: I went more than a year without cutting my hair. I finally cut it in September 2014 (my last haircut had been July 2013!) and got 4 inches off. I had it cut again a month later because there were still split ends, so I had another 2 inches taken off. My hair was a lot better, but I still noticed some split ends. I waited about four months to have my hair trimmed in February, and since then I just got a haircut a couple days ago. I had 3 inches cut this time because I noticed my split ends were still really bad. I was looking at my hair and I still see split ends. 

I think my hair is still weak from the time I didn t cut my hair for a year because it seems like every time I get a haircut, there are still split ends. I try to cut my hair enough so that they are gone, but they never are. 

When getting a haircut, how much above the split ends do I need to cut? I usually cut an inch above where the split ends start, but maybe that s not enough. What would you recommend to ensure that I can cut all of the dead ends off?

TITLE:  Question about flossing?
BODY: hi!! Well I've had braces for 7 months now, and lol in my whole life I've never flossed, and when I went to the ortho, they told me my gums are really puffy and i need to start flossing, so I took the pledge.. And started flossing. I do it in the morning after breakfast and before i sleep. And although, it's time consuming, it's fun for me and I did something good for myself and my ortho and my parents (money) and it makes me happier! But When I floss i do it after i brush, and when I floss.. Nothing comes out on the string? Is there nothing really there cause i got it out with the brushing or did i just push it downward whatever food was there? Please help.. Why is this? Btw i have an electric toothbrush if that helps.

BODY: Well our cat is in heat currently and we want her spayed as soon as she cycles out. Problem is the vet wants 200$ estimate for the spay. We would have to save up for about two months. There is also a low cost spay/neuter clinic that charges 50$. We could do it as soon as she cycles out. Is the quality of care the same? I really love our vet,but the cat is driving us bonkers. Also the vet is a 15-20 min ride and the low cost clinic would be a 45 min ride.  Which do you think is the better option?

TITLE:  How to make cat stop jumping on my feet when Im in bed?
BODY: well I recently adopted one adorable cat 2 days ago, I named him Lemmy - hes a good cat but when I go in bed he comes to cuddle then all of a sudden he starts to use his instinct jumping on my feet - he might be thinking its something else hiding under the blanket cause when I uncover my feet he sees its me and he starts to cuddle. The vet said that he might think the bed his territory already and tries to get me out - and if I allow him to jump he will continue - so can you give me advice what to do - he has some toys he has house with scratcher and toy and again when I go to bed he comes and starts to play and bite my feet. hes still a kitten like 7-8 month - still young but I have to do something to make him stop. Last night I had to get him out of my bedroom so I can get some sleep, though to cuddle with cat in the night is sweet but it wont work out this way. I have had other cat before he slept next to my ears never did this.

Can I do something to stop him - cause in the other part of the day hes adorable and loving - in the night he starts to behave like punk - I even think to rename him Punky

BODY: So my friend had surgery a couple years ago to fix strabismus (one of her eyes used to turn outwards). Ever since then her eyes are aligned almost perfectly only e. g. when she squints because of bright sunlight, (you know how sometimes when you do that, one eye is more "squinty" and you can't see out of it anymore but it's not completely closed) the "squintier" eye turns outward again almost as if she didn't have the surgery. Is this called intermittent exotropia? Is this normal even after surgery?

TITLE:  Question about my skills?
BODY: ok so I've been boxing for 4 years so far but the issue is that only two of the years i got to spar and train at the gym but due to a financial situation (which is finally getting better fortunately)  i had to train all the basics i learned at home. I've made sure to practice only the basics and refine them by shadow boxing and bag work. Now i'm ultimately concerned with whether i pprobably lost a significant amount of skill.  I mean i am still pretty confident within myself as i know what it's like to take a punch from several full contact sessions. It's that i feel like i'm slowly degrading. The cheapest gym closest to me doesn't have any form of training so i just go there to lift and run. Now my primary goal is building muscle as i've gotten into bodybuilding but my question is whether i should casually practice my boxing just for the sake of retaining whatever skills i have.

BODY: My hair isn't frizzy. Much worse, it's damaged. While frizzy hair can be styled in a cute way somehow, my thick, medium length, damaged hair looks dead. Although I know getting rid of damaged hair should be the first step, the process takes too long. Therefore I need a casual haircut/hairstyle that I can use outside while I treat my hair at home. Just so you guys know - I hate gothic looks such as layered, razored hair cuts. That does work for my hair either.

TITLE:  What to ask for at barbers ? (mens)?
BODY: Hi, this may sound dumb but every time I go to the barbers they never really cut it the way I like, its probably because I'm not telling them what to do properly..

Anyway I am getting another cut in a few hours but can anyone tell me what I should ask the barber for? I currently have a medium cut mop.. I need something fresh and clean for a wedding tomorrow, but not a crew cut :) I see a lot of my friends asking for 2's, 1's, and 0's.. would appreciate any advice.. thanks

TITLE:  Glasses making things look smaller?
BODY: I got two pairs of glasses from America's best, and my prescription did increase. One pair is a small metal frame circular pair, the other is a more box like plastic frame. In the plastic frames everything looks smaller. Also when I turn my head to look at things from the side it's like a fun house mirror. Is this normal for larger frames? The smaller frames are no problem. Everything is the right size, and no warped vision.

TITLE:  Speck of something in eye?
BODY: So at some point yesterday, I felt like there was a grain of stand in my eye. It wasn't going away after a little while so I looked in the mirror and noticed this small speck or dirt or something on my cornea. I closed my eyes and looked side to side to try and move it. It didn't at all. I tried to flush it out with water. Same thing, it didn't move at all. I figured I'd just go to bed and see if it got better in the morning. It didn't. It's still there, and every time I blink, it still feels like there's a grain of sand on my eye. Should I be concerned? I'm not sure if I should set up an appointment with someone or if I should just wait it out and hope it goes away.

TITLE:  Is it wrong to get your hair did at a place where your old hairstylist works?
BODY: So it's kind of a franchise in my area. I had been getting my hair did with a girl that graduated from my high school. We have a lot of mutual friends and I'm related to some of her family but me and her aren't "friends". I have blonde hair and she used to do a really good job but lately she's been turning my hair orange, or giving me completely brown hair with three blonde streaks when I asked for lowlights lol. This girl on my Facebook got her hair did blonde and it looked super good but when I went to the stylist's page that did it I realized she works at the same place with the girl that has been doing my hair. Would it be wrong/rude if I went got my hair did with the other girl anyhow I know my old hairstylist will be there? I say "old hairstylist" but the last time she did my hair was about a month ago and I've been going to her for about a year and a half.

TITLE:  Wisdom tooth extraction tomorrow! What to expect?
BODY: Hello, i have a FULL ON horizontally impacted 3rd molar tooth that is going to be taken out TOMORROW. The thing is that it has not (and i dont think it will ever will because its growing horizontally) erupted out of my gums. My question is, if you've ever had an impacted molar extracted:
 1. does it hurt?
 2. How long did your procedure took?
 3. I opted to go for local anesthetics, will the pain be any different than going for general anesthetic?
 4. How many days did it take to recover?
 5. How many weeks/days will it take to have my braces put on after the procedure?

I planned on asking the surgeon if i could listen to my music via earphones to distract me from the drilling noise. I dont know what im feeling right now. I just want it to be over and done with. Please share your experiences it means alot!!

BODY: Title: Pieces

My dear,
What have we become?
A daylight nightmare plagues me from inside
While hate breeds within the soul.

Unforgiving flames freeze us still
Incinerating past memories to ash.

Haze fogs the mind to complete obscurity,
Questioning myself over and over again
How can this be reality?
Yet the answer is as clear as my animosity.

Broken and beaten,
Swollen with unamended lies.
Clashing of glass echoes across time
As the heart is shattered,
Scattered as far as the love I once conceived

TITLE:  My cat hates to be held or touched ?
BODY: Hi, my cat is 2 years old, we adopted her when she was only 1 month old, and she grew up with us as an indoor fluffy ball, We love her so much, but the problem is, she doesn't know anything about affection, she only knows to bite and scratch, My hands are full of scars because of her, And whenever i touch her or try to pet her, She becomes aggressive, and when i pick her up it's even worse, she keeps meowing telling me to let her go and then she runs away, Sometimes, she comes to us and give us some love by touching us tail up and giving me her head to pet her, But most of times she doesn't like it when we touch her or hold her, Why is she like that ? I really wish i can hold her for 10 minutes or so cause she's a cutie, and i want to show her how much i love her, but she hates it, She never sit on my lap or something, Only when she wants to we can pet her, But if we pet her without her permission she becomes horrible, HELP ?

TITLE:  My hair never grows past my shoulders? Any good products?
BODY: I've been trying to grow my hair out for two years now, and I feel like there has been very little progress. It's only a little bit thicker, and a few centimetres longer than it was two years ago. I massage my scalp, put argon oil in my hair 3-4 times a week, use Moroccan argon oil shampoo and conditioner but there is still little hair growth. My hair is just past my shoulders, and is still thin. Is there a product I should use for hair growth? I do go to the hairdressers about once every 2 months? Should I go more? 

Thanks.

TITLE:  My kitten is having trouble getting used to me.?
BODY: No trolling, please.

I just got a kitten a week and a half ago. I've confined him to the bathroom so he has a small space to adjust to. He has food, water, litter box, toys, and a bed. Two days in he got stuck in the bathtub so I picked him up to put him down. I'd held him before without any issue, so I figured this would be fine. Well he began hissing, clawing, and even biting to get away, and went into hiding. I started sleeping on the floor to help him get used to me. When I'm laying down and the lights are off, he's very inquisitive. He walks around, plays with his toys, even will crawl under the blanket along my back. But the moment I lean up, even just to turn the light on when he's across the room, he hisses and backs away. I haven't tried to touch him since he panicked the first time so that I'm not pressuring him too much.

I don't know if this is the most progress I could be making, or if I could do more. 

No trolling, please.

TITLE:  How should I go about dying my hair purple. TIPS?
BODY: Hello, I have always wanted to dye my hair since forever. I have never been able to because of strict high school, jobs and parents. Now I am off to college in a month or so and even if I wanted to, I cant get a job first year of college. So yay!! Perfect time to dye my hair!! I do have a couple concerns though. I have red hair (main factor why my parents said no to color). To get the color I want, I would have to bleach my hair. So whenever I want to go back to my regular hair color... I cant. not even the really fancy salons have my hair color, well, maybe... only if I spent an arm and a leg on it. But I'm not doing that. So long story short, how do I switch from color to regular or do I just let it grow out? and if  I have to grow it out, how long will it take? Basically, does anybody have any tips for me? and please, I do not what to hear "Awww don't dye your hair, red is a pretty color" blah blah blah. im sorry, ive just heard that all my life and I don't like hearing it.

TITLE:  Is this Ragdoll kitten show quality?
BODY: Hello, im just curious as to wether my kitten would have any disqualifications if I were to show her. The breeder said that she has beautiful markings, but im trying to learn what disqualifies cats and what makes them grand champions. I will attend some shows at some point, but its not going to be possible any time in the near future.  So if there are any websites that could help or any info, id appreciate it! 

The kitten in the photos is Tinkerbell AKA-Tink and AAKA Bella! She is a 5 month old seal mitted girl. She is perfect in my eyes, but I want to know what the judges may say about her, appearance wise. 

Yahoo answers will not allow me to post anymore than 1 photo, so if anyone really knows their stuff when it comes to these astounding cats, and would be willing to email me, PLEASE let me know. I would be more than happy to email you several pics so you can see all of her markings. 

Thanks in advance, 
And, PLEASE,  for the love of God, BE KIND IN YOUR ANSWERS! 

Have a blessed day!

I look forward to hearing what everyone thinks! :-)

TITLE:  How do I bring a feral kitten indoors?
BODY: We bought a house a few weeks ago and discovered a kitten under our shed. He s about 2-3 months old. There are 2 other cats we ve seen only a few times so I don t know if those are the parents or not. I don t want to seperate them if they are. He seems to be alone tho because he s the only one that comes out from under the shed and stuff. We ve been feeding him and giving fresh water and he s come to be affectionate now. I don t want to scare him once he s inside and he freaks out. Any tips on how to handle this?

TITLE:  Hairdressers... what is the best way to get my natural blonde hair back?
BODY: I've dyed my natural strawberry-blonde locks every color over the past 3 years... I've been auburn, dark brow-black, light ash brown, light golden brown, medium golden brown.... My hair has been bleached 3 times and it's not in the best shape, although it's not terrible.

Currently, my hair is a light reddish/brown/blonde mix... I have about 1/2 inch of strawberry blonde roots. I want to go to a salon to get back to my natural color, but what service is the best way to do that? Should I ask for blonde highlights that match my roots, or should I get my entire head bleached and toned to match the roots?

TITLE:  Why does my cat meow/whine at me when she catches her wand toy? No matter if I drop it, gently/playfully tug, or pet her.?
BODY: My cat is a 1 year old DLH (as far as the vet can tell), and recently when she catches the mouse on the wand toy she will straddle the string facing away from me and pull as if we are playing tug-of-war. I will usually gently and playfully tug a little because I assume that's what she wants. However occasionally she'll meow at me, which sounds a bit like a little whine, as if she wants me to either keep tugging or let go. However, when I do let go of the toy she meows again as if that's not what she wanted either. Or if I pet her while the mouse is in her mouth she will meow/whine at me again.

Sometimes I'll hang onto the wand and say "good girl!", and she will let go of the toy. I'm not sure if she's looking for appreciation or if it's because I have (accidentally) taught her this when we're playing with a bouncy ball. (She'll drop it/walk away when I say this after she pounces on the bouncy ball).

Not sure if this helps, but occasionally she'll drag her toy around and meow a little. I assume it's because she wants to play because when I grab it she'll run away and duck down, like she's waiting to pounce.

But I've had a power chain for 4 months and it hasn't closed a single space, it only seems to make the spaces bigger! What do you think the problem is?

TITLE:  Kitten won't stop meowing, very annoyed, help?
BODY: So I was at Walmart when I saw this lady with a box of free kittens. There were only two left. When I saw the black one pop it's head out I fell in love. The lady gave me no info whatsoever, only his age which was 5 weeks old. I will agree it was very wrong to take a 5 week old kitten away from his mom so soon! But at the time I did not know.. Well he is now 11 weeks and just hell to deal with

He loves being around me but his meowing is driving me crazy! And now it seems a lot worse than when I first got him. Any tips on what I can do? 

Even if he's around me he'll still meow. His meows can be like a chirp "Which is fine" OR WORSE! Which is a scream like someone tied him down and ripping his legs out while beating him! The scream I cannot handle. Even my puppy tries to run away when he screams like that.. 

If it's night and I put him in his bed he'll be fine "Until he hears me up that is" I know nothing about kittens but do know my ex's friend had one and it did not do this! I am getting very, very, highly annoyed by this. What can I do? I do try to pet him or be around him a lot. It's not like I lock him away or don't feed him .... I do not understand why he is acting like this! 

Other than that he will be fine. He loves being pet and played with, it's just his screaming/meowing 24/7

TITLE:  Why does my kitten only pee in his litter box?
BODY: So my 11 week old kitten used to just pee everywhere. Where ever he pees I would put his litter box in that spot, or if I caught him peeing, I would remove him from the spot putting him in his litter box, but not forcing him to stay in it so he got the point .

Well he now pees in his litter box only. Now the pooping is an huge issue! He'll poop in his litter box sometimes, but mostly do it under my bed which is gross! Me and my boyfriend know he has poop under there when we both try to sleep and smell it! And I do not want his litter box under our bed or every time he poops, even if we're asleep, we'll smell it! Also only kitty can fit under our bed...

Pulling out the bed is so annoying just to clean up poop. And this is once a night, or we'll have to check once a night to make sure there is no poop. I do not get why kitty thinks his pooping spot is right under where our heads lay. "But thank god he doesn't do it in our bed"! 

So how can I train him to poop in his litter box too? Any tips would be helpful!

TITLE:  Lipstick questions? (FOR FACE PAINTING)?
BODY: I am planning to get into face painting (ect) and my first party is most likely going to be August! Now, thats probably nothing to many people (for getting money) but I never really have any money. 
I have a Clinique A Different Grape lipstick (which is a great shade of red for blood effects/bruises!! I got it right perfectly my first try with it!) but its a bit too expensive for me, which is a huge OH NO. Is there hopefully a lipstick of the same shade that is cheap (and I can find it on amazon?)? 
Also what face paint kits do you use? I may get a snazaroo one (its cheap and many homestuck cosplayers recommend it!!).  Is that good for first timers or should I get something else? (Please include amazon links, ect)

TITLE:  Please help my cat has been having constant diarrhea for the past two and a half weeks?!?
BODY: My cat is long haired and 10 years old. He's been healthy for most of part expect he had to get help for gastronitus a year ago. He is indoor cat but we let him out sometimes for couple minutes on our front porch. 

  He has been having yellowish runny diarrhea for little over 2 weeks now. Nothing has been helping we went to vet a week ago (since I noticed a little blood in his stool)  or so and she gave him these nasty tasting antibiotics that he would take but weren't helping him. (Sideffects of antibiotics were diarrhea) so we called vet and she said to stop the medicine because there is some bacteria shown in the fecal sample. So she suggested giving him part of human antidiarrhea tablet and feeding him boiled chicken and rice to make the stool harder. 
It's been a week and he's still having diarrhea everyday. He's eating normally and drinking a lot more and acting normal but just more tired then usual. He's been trying to cough up some hair balls recently without much coming up only spit. He's not vomiting any. 

So I'm just trying to figure out what to do since our vet just wants us to wait til Monday and see how he is. The vet doesn't know what's wrong and she wants to run all these tests and stuff before giving other medication. But my mom is fed up with them trying to suggest tests when they don't know and they cost a lot. Last time we went to vet they did many unnecessary tests and ended up costing my mom $900 

So any advice would be appreciated thanks :)

TITLE:  Thick, straight hair turned wavy when cut?
BODY: So I had around 26-28 inch hair about 2 years ago; I cut it into a bob-cut and it was straight, but once my hair started growing longer, it turned wavy? It was never wavy before, just absolutely straight. 
I want to get a short haircut again, but my hair is so thick and wavy that it would look bad on me.
I guess overall what I'm asking is, why did my hair turn wavy when cut and how can I thin it out/make it straight again?

TITLE:  Eye problems?
BODY: I've been having a lot of strange probelms with my eyes. I'm due for the doctor soon and I want to do some research on what the problem is but I don't know what I should look for.  I'll see perfectly fine one minute and be messed up the next. It's not a consent problem so glasses won't help much. I'll see weird things occasionally from small moving circles to white flashes. Sometimes my vision will completely turn white for a few moments. A little white ago I was seeing white dots. I've been having this problem for months and it's starting to get worse. Any kind of light hurts me. Even a simple nightlight and my eyes are always sore like they want to pop out. And I can't sleep very well because of that. If anyone knows what this is can you please tell me?

I don't want a short haircut though.
I was thinking about something with layers, like this maybe: http://cuthairstylefreshh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/long-layered-hairstyles-pinterest-image.jpg

What do you think? Any other suggestions?

TITLE:  My cat is really sick and I need help?
BODY: My cat is now a little over a year old and he has almost never eaten a full meal without throwing something up. It all started when he was born, He was the first litter to my cat that I had gotten when I was younger. She had 4 kittens but only 3 of them made it. But hes the only one that has this eating issue. I first noticed something was wrong when he switched form milk to cat food. He would throw up this white foam stuff. After this went on  for a bit I took him to the vet. she told me that there was nothing we could do but switch his cat food. So, I did and this worked for a while until Just this mouth. Hes lost a lot of weight and wont eat almost anything. And the only thing i can get him to eat makes him even sicker.

BODY: I didn't have an open bite until a few years ago, but now it's pretty bad, my whole bite is basically open according to the orthodontist I saw for a consultation, they even said they are surprised I can eat (I only seem to have a little difficulty if im trying to eat a lot in one bite)

What do they do to correct an open bite besides braces? 

I mostly don't want to have to have to go through oral surgery; getting wisdom teeth removed is bad enough, which I already had done a couple of years back 

But I guess if it comes to it ill get whatever done or go through whatever to improve my smile 

I will have my next appointments in August

BODY: I've suspected before that my cat Rosie was pregnant but I wasn't for sure until last week. She's gotten HUGE and she carries further up in her ribcage. She's gotten very lazy and loveable. Her nipples are red/pink but she won't let me squeeze them to see if milk comes out. Please help me asap. 
I also want to know some helpful tips on helping her with her delivery. She's less than a year old and she was abandoned from her mom as a young kitten, so young that I was bottle feeding her for about a month after I brought her in and I'm afraid she's not going to know what to do.
I appreciate all the help I can get.

But I am getting up there and they are deep set and face hooding someday. During my life time I have rarely worn much makeup, maybe mascara now and then but definitely need more now and I want to look polish and sometimes sexy and of course enhance my natural good looks. I am a natural when it comes to make-up and a natural beauty, but middle aged. So should I create a smoky eye or do the standard eye makeup shading.  I have large deep set brown eyes.

TITLE:  Can i get restitution for what the British did to my people?
BODY: I live in Port Harcourt,Nigeria.A while ago i was having a conversation with my mother and i asked her about my people and where they came from. She explained to me and told me origin of how we come from the Benin Kingdom or Benin Empire as it is popularly known. I became intrigued and wanted to know more about my people and so i went online and did a lot of research and found out a lot (but still limited) about my peoples culture and history. The Benin kingdom was a pre-colonial African empire that dates back all the way back to the eleventh century C.E. Turns out it's pretty impressive and i have a proud heritage. From stories i've head they were pretty successful,had a well structured social hierarchy and were very wealthy and had many resources (i think Gold was the most plentiful of them). I was proud and happy up to the point where i found out what the British did to them. Long story short the British wanted resources that they had and tricked them by striking a bargain with them, before they could realize what was going on it was to late and the British came and stole,raided,pillaged and destroyed them plus also stealing a lot of their cultural artifacts like the gold statues you see in the picture. Some of our older generations still remember remnants of tales that have been past down of the riches of the empire and the horrors and treachery of what the white men did. Here are links if you want to know more in detail

BODY: she has recently overcome being bitten in the leg. the bite got infected and the vet treated it. the bite got reinfected a few weeks later, and we got her treated again, and then she was fine. 

....her wound healed a while ago, but every couple weeks she has a day or two where her mouth gets gooey and every once in a while she will cry as if she doesnt feel good. we dont think she is getting fevers, but her mouth seems to get gooey right at the same time that she starts complaining about feeling lousy.

TITLE:  How do you break a tongue thrusting habit on your own?
BODY: So I have this tongue thrusting habit I seem to do when im bored or maybe anxious/stressed

I just place my tongue on the roof of my mouth and keep tongue thrusting from the front to the back and I just keep doing it

I never even knew this was tongue thrusting until my orthodontic consultation last Friday when they asked me I to swallow to see if I tongue thrust when I swallow and now that im going to get braces  (probably in August) im trying to break this tongue thrusting habit, but I keep catching myself trying to keep doing it

What would be a good way to break this habit ASAP? Idk if its actually possible to make my already bad open bite (basically my whole bite is open, it became like this from my tongue thrusting habit after I lost two teeth and got significant gaps in my top row of teeth  (estimated at 5mm) ) even worse by August, but I don't want to risk it

BODY: I bought very expensive hair extensions about a year ago. They matched when I bought them but now they do not. My hair is ashy and the extensions are more chestnut and have a reddish tint to them. How do I get rid of it? Going to the salon to dye them costs at least $200 and I don't want to spend over $500 just for longer, thicker hair.

TITLE:  Tips for a new contact lenses user?
BODY: I'm 13 years old. I've had my contacts since about 2 weeks. However, I still take some time to put them on. Some days I'll have them in under 5 minutes. Other days, I'll take more than 20. 
What is hard for me is to get them to stick in. Also, I have long eyelashes for a boy, so they tend to get stuck in them. Another thing that is hard for me is to tell if they're inside out. Can anyone help me with some tips?
Btw, I'm fine with taking them off. It's easy as cake.

TITLE:  How do I learn to plait my own hair?
BODY: I am a black guy who's been growing his hair for the past 3-5 years. For much of that time, I left if as an afro, but for the past year or so, I've been having it plaited to help it grow. 

But that's expensive, and sometimes I want to have an afro for a while. So, I want to learn to do my own hair, at least to plait it up at night (even in big, sloppy plaits) so it's protected as I sleep, and there's less breakage when I comb it. And then learn to do more advanced stuff. But I have NO experience in plaiting at all. 

So, I'm asking how can I learn to plait from scratch and develop enough that I can plait my own hair?

BODY: I literally know nothing about poetry, but I'm in a mood. I love to be alone, and to immerse myself in thought. One of my happiest fantasies is that the world is devoid of people and I live in a cabin, alone. Weird and bleak, I know. I just happened to stumble upon a poem bc I had a random thought and googled it. It was pretty much exactly what I was thinking too, oddly. I was just wondering if there are other poems like this. Anything having to do with hermitism, solitude, or isolation.

I can't afford a vet at this time :( it seems like when I start struggling with money my animals get sick is there a way I can take care of this on my own? And will they be okay..? My mom said if it still kept on she will help me taken them to the vet to on Thursday..I also asked my vet if they do any payment plans and they told me no and everywhere else in my town doesn't do that either..I just don't want my poor babies getting worse :( they aren't energetic like they usually are and it hurts me to see them like this.. I just want to know if this can cure on its own..I also am keeping them quarantined in my room so they don't get my dog sick and I've cleaned every little thing in my room so there isn't any bacteria..also my cats are indoor

So I saw this hair and I fell in love. I wanted to try it on myself but I don't think it will look good. First off, I have brown eyes, while the girl in the picture has blue. I have kinda a long face and a big nose. My skin isn't superrrr pale but I'm also not tan. My hair is just under my shoulders and is pretty thick. I made an appointment to dye my hair this color in a week but I'm having second thoughts. (I'm not super pretty). Im 15 but This hair is just for the summer so I'm not worried about school

TITLE:  Kitten Help!?
BODY: My kitten who I'm not sure of age, all I know is the vet is okay with him getting vaccines and being neutered, started with an eye infection and a little sneezing. We went to the vet he gave us some ear mite stuff and a gel for his eye to help with the infection but did not give us anything for the source of the infection until our second visit when he also gave him his first set of vaccines. He eats, drinks, and plays right but his sneezing has gotten so much worse along with slight wheezing. His eye isn't much better and we have finished the medicines from the first visit. He's sleeping more but the vet said that was normal after being given a vaccine but I guess you could say I'm a worried momma. Right now he's on my shoulder begging for pets, which happily am giving. I've been wiping his eyes and nose clean of the gunk and it's been 3 days since his medicine finished so I've started giving him Vetericyn Opthalmic Gel.. What more can I do? He looks and sounds so miserable. :( Thank you in advance for ANY help.

TITLE:  Makeup help!?
BODY: ok so I really want to wear makeup, but my parents won't let me. I know how to properly apply it but my mom keeps making excuses like "you dont need it" I know I don't need it it's something i want to do. "its bad for your skin" theirs brands out there that aren't bad for your skin "it's pointless" well pressed powder on my oily skin wouldnt be 'worthless' it would make my skin matte "because I said so" thats not a valid reason -_-.  I'm thinking of just going shopping with my friend who lives by the mall and going to target and getting 
-pressed powder
-eyelash curler 
-clear mascara
-lip gloss
Would this be noticeable? Because last time they cought me with brownish black mascara on they took my phone. I'm 13 btw going into 8th grade and everyone wears makeup and people say i look like im 9 and my skins shiny. I feel alot more confident with even just clear mascara on. Should i just buy it and wear it to school secretly? I take the bus so would that help?

BODY: Whenever I stick something close to my face, within 3 inches, the object looks blurry and out of focus and gets blurrier the closer to my face. My vision is not blurry enough that I have trouble reading, but I do find myself needing to use my finger to keep up if i'm reading print small enough. Is this minor farsightedness? is this a common sign that I will eventually need glasses for farsightedness? Will this slight blur progress into a fair amount of farsightedness with time?

TITLE:  I ACCIDENTALLY SHOT MY CAT 😩?
BODY: I'm beyond depressed right now.. 
Yesterday I was sneaking into my neighbor's house again to cut holes in all of his condoms.. He made fun of me when I told him he can get his gf pregnant and that condoms don't guarantee safe sex anymore. Like, I was having sex with a condom once and the girls boyfriend shot me in the arm. Nope, doesn't guarantee safe sex.. I wanted to prove it to him.. Anyway, when I sneaked into his house via the back door, my cat followed me.. I didn't notice till I was in the bedroom and my cat started humping his cat! I saw something moving and making noise in the dark, so I thought it was a sea monster and immediately shot it 😭 he woke up and started yelling at me, but a small bullet in his leg silenced him for good.. I came closer to the monster. And shot it 8  times when I saw it moving. I came closer and I found out it was my cat 😩 what can I do to bring her back?

TITLE:  Question for dentists and dental assistants?
BODY: I just started this new job as a dental assistant a few months ago. Today I was rushing and I wasn't thinking and I accidently put a handpiece in the ultrasonic. The assistant I work with actually started yelling at me for doing this. 

I was wondering if the handpiece is damaged? I think its called a kavo

Thanks

TITLE:  My cat is going crazy!?
BODY: My cat is sprinting through the house, and bouncing off the couch and it's driving me nuts. I know this is normal, and I already played with her for like 15 minutes with the laser, and she already ate. But i just got stitches in my finger today and this is why I need to know how to calm her down. She has already run over my hand multiple times and I'm in so much pain because of it. Our chihuaua is running with her, but she seems to be in her own world because even when he stops to rest she keeps going. Any tips on how to calm her for the night so I can go to sleep and not worry about her ripping out my stitches!?

TITLE:  Could this cat have had rabies? Please help!?
BODY: I found this poor feral cat that had a dropped jaw and a broken canine. I took it to the vet and he told me it had a paralysed jaw and had to be put to sleep if not survive on medication and liquid food. The thing is I don't really know if the poor thing had rabies. It would behave normally and purr. It was not violent at all and generally did not have any cardinal rabies symptoms like foam going out of the mouth and disoriented behaviour. It was just the dropped jaw that  made me dubious about its condition because it says in some websitesthat rabid cats and animals in general would had a dropped jaw The cat did not have  aquaphobia ( a major symptom of rabies), but I got minor scratches from it when I gave it a warm bath that she actually enjoyed. Could the Jaw paralysis have been a symptom of rabies? a hard kick from some jerk? ( mind the canine was broken!) Should I worry? Please I need your advice and espcially opinion from trained vets and professionals.

Thanks!

TITLE:  Dilated pupil. After having a stye? Mucusy? Help?
BODY: About a week ago i had a stye on my left eye. It was pretty bad but it went away after three days of putting warm cloths on it. 
Today I noticed mucusy stuff in it throughout the day in that same eye, it gets in the way of me seeing clearly. Then i went to the restroom and for some odd reason decided to look in my eyes and saw the pupil was pretty big. Especially on my left eye. Idk if im overreacting because im a very anxiety prone person or if its a serious problem. I can still feel on my eyelid the small round stye and it hurts if i press too hard. 
What do i do :( cant call my mom. Shes asleep by now because were in different time zones :(

TITLE:  BRACES POKING PLEASE HELP?!?
BODY: There's a wire poking on my braces AND IT HURTS SO FREAKING BAD!!! I literally tried every single thing to do. Wax won't stay on no matter how dry mouth it. The wire pokes a hole through it anyway so it makes no difference. When I got my braces tightened, I asked them to cut it but they said there was no wire and it was just the hook. THATS NOT TRUE! I feel the wire and the hook and they are 2 separate things. I have white blisters all over my cheek so what am I supposed to do? My parents hate me so if I tell them anything they say I have ocd. I'm about to literally ply the braces out of my mouth.

TITLE:  Is there still a way to correct my weak lower jaw cause by an overbite?
BODY: I have a very weak jawline and I always have. It runs on my dad side of the family- they all have small lower jaws and overbites. I got braces when I was 10 and had them on until I was 14. My ortho gave me two options to correct my overbite and they were jaw surgery or just using rubber bands and pulling two adult teeth to shift them around and make the overbite visually disappear. I have always been really self conscious about my jaw and it makes my profile look very unattractive (I have that kind of bunched up chin skin that a weak jaw causes even though I am very thin). I am realizing now that there are ways orthodontists are correcting overbites that also correct jaw structure and improve not only appearance but health as well. Apparently having a weak jaw bone can cause health problems (I already feel like my jaw is usually tight of uncomfortable). I have read that most people with a "smaller" lower jaw do not actually have a smaller jaw, it is just misplaced. But since my teeth are already corrected would there be a way for me to use one of these treatments to correct my jawbone placement?

TITLE:  How to impress her?
BODY: this her is my mom. Im 13 Going into 8th grade and I REALLY want to wear makeup. I know how to apply makeup and I know the basics and a BIT above (not trying to brag) But whenever i ask if i can wear powder clear/brown mascara and tinted lipgloss (im allowed to wear clear or any elf hypershine lipgloss but i have all of them already and i would like to experiment with other brands) And curl my eyelashes (she thinks ill pull my lashes out). Im on summer break right now and i go back the 22 of next month (july) and i would like to wear makeup before then. She said i have to impress her first and then i also have to see what my dad says. My parents are the type to take my phone away if they see me with ny friends mascara on one day that I put on during pe. So how can I impress my mom and dad? My dads really over protective but he wouldn't notice if I wore these things but my mom would notice immediately and call me out rudely. I've explained numerous times that i want to wear makeup because it seems fun and not to look better but she gives stupid excuses and saying i need to impress her. i dont know what to do. Can someone enlighten me as to what I can say or do

TITLE:  Cat losing leg fur?
BODY: I have a four year old Siamese named Duchess who is a rescue pet. She managed to escape a brutal Siamese breeder and was found by a no kill shelter where ultimately made her part of my home and she was about 8 months old when I got her. I have another cat in the apartment, a beautiful Bombay and the two cats get along famously. They sleep, eat, play and groom one another frequently. No new changes have occurred in the household w respect to say her diet or outside exposure, but I can't figure out why she's losing her hair on her legs. This started around four months ago and I'm at a total loss on how to stop it. Can anyone help?

TITLE:  Why would my cat abandon only some of her babies?
BODY: My Cat just had 5 babies. She had 1 kitten &amp; then had the second one a few hours later , the next day the first kitten died. Then about 2 days later the second one died , after she had not taken care of either kittens. That same day she had 3 more kittens. 2 days have passed and we have had to buy a heat pad &amp; kitten bottles to feed them &amp; keep them warm because she will run out of the house for most of the day. We've noticed that she is leaving a kitten out. Like, taking it to other areas in the room &amp; leaving it there. We had thought in the beginning when the first two kittens died, that it was because the house was too cold , now we are thinking that she is trying to kill them. Need some answers soon...

TITLE:  Does riding horses help with dirt bikes?
BODY: So I wanted to know if riding horses helps with dirt bikes? I am fifteen and I ve been riding horses for eight years and still do, and according to everyone I am good. My lessons teacher says I have very good balance and strong legs and I can jump five foot fences on horse back. i barely fall and when I do it s not bad because I can hold on for the amount of time to know how I want to land. Also I don t know if it matters but most sites I ve seen say weight training helps and since I am on my highschools volley ball team I have to weight train every day for an hour. I just wanted to know if all this would help my balance in general on a dirt bike and do I have an advantage to get better on one since I ride horses? Will it also help with jumping on a dirt bike since I can jump five foot fences because everyone is all empresses and say that s high.

TITLE:  Did the dentist hit a nerve?
BODY: I went to the dentist on Monday and got three fillings (all on the bottom). It always takes forever for me to get numb.. so I got 4 shots, all in the same area. It's been almost a week now and it's still pretty sore around the injection site. It even looks like I have a bruise on the inside of my cheek.. I've had a lot of dental work and injections and never had this happen.. is it possible that he hit a nerve, or could it just be because he gave me so many shots?

BODY: Okafor is the next Tim Duncan. Can't teach height and can't teach that footwork. However, you CAN teach DEFENSE which is what a lot of people seem to criticize Jahlil for. You can teach defense, but that dizzying array of post moves he has? Nah. 

Smart Lakers fans will be pissed about this draft choice. Could have had the next Tim Duncan, but instead you chose the next bust.

Not sure why people are so high on this Ohio State product, D'Angelo Russell. He's just some kid from a team that went nowhere significant in the NCAA tournament.
He ain't that good.

TITLE:  Any dental surgeons on Yahoo, can you tell me if I should still be bleeding?
BODY: I had a molar taken out yesterday (the medical form said S.6 if that helps) and it is still bleeding a little. I know that the molar is close to my sinuses, could me breathing through my nose be affecting the gum and stopping it from healing? The pamphlet I have tells me that I should expect blood-stained saliva for up to 2 days after the operation, but I can actually taste blood, and I'm not sure if that's meant to happen. Everyhing else sounds normal - I should feel a little pain and I should not mess around with it (which I haven't, though one of my stitches came out yesterday, which did not affect the amount of bleeding at all - they are dissolvable stitches so maybe the gum had healed in that spot?). Thanks in advance for your efforts.

BODY: I noticed this like month or 2 ago. I didnt take much notice, but when i combed my hair, I saw a alarming amount of hair. This went on for about a month until I noticed the hair on my bedsheets. I told my mom about it, and we wont to the doctor to get appointed. I'm appointed for a Thyroid
doctor to check my thyriod and a dermatologist (did I pronounce it correctly, english isn't my native language). But I'm worried they wont find the problem and I dont want to be bald at the age of 17. My hair is my best trait. I have thick long hair. I have way to skinny legs for a 14 year old boy, I have pectus excavatum (sunken chest). And I already have trouble getting a girlfriend and being bald isnt helping the cause.  My face doesnt match with a bald hairstyle. No1 in my family is bald. Noone. My dad is 59 so he is getting a little balder but he is almost 60. How can I prevent further hair loss.

BODY: When the British were kicked out of india,  lots of Indians came to America because to stay in London. So is India still in Asia or is it not in Southern America near mexico? If that's the case, then why was Hitler even responsible for the holocaust because it wouldn't have happened if the british left India. So what is the answer to both those questions? Thanks.

TITLE:  Bad oral hygiene but healthy teeth?
BODY: So in my 13 years of living I have rarely brushed my teeth, and I know that s really bad but recently I have been taking much better care of my teeth. So the other day I went the dentist after 2 years since my last visit, and I found out I have no cavities. My teeth are a little yellow but nothing to bad, my gums are not inflamed at all, I rarely feel any pain from my teeth or gums, I also don t wear braces because my teeth are straight, and I have no cavities at all   (I have had one or two cavities in the past though). I also don t drink very much water, I never drink soft drinks (I don t like how they taste), and I do eat candy and baked goods like brownies pretty often. So I was just wondering how are my teeth in such good condition? I guess the fact that I have celiac disease could contribute to it because, it means I can t eat wheat. But Does anyone have any ideas as to why my teeth are healthy despite my bad oral hygiene?

BODY: 1. While Europe’s Renaissance did not instantly reshape life around the world, the world as we know it today was born during the Renaissance. Define Renaissance and provide at least two examples of each of the following: new ideas, attitudes and inventions that arose. All parts of the question must be answered.

2. During the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the biggest conflict was not military but religious. Many Church leaders paid more attention to political power and getting rich than to spiritual pursuits. Many ordinary people grew disgusted at this corruption of Church leaders. One critic, who was also a monk, teacher and biblical scholar, publically criticized the sale of indulgences. What were indulgences and who was the critic? How did he make his criticism public? What do we call the religious movement to reform the Church? Include a description of indulgences and the person famous for criticizing their sale. Also tell how he made his criticism public and what we call the movement to reform the Catholic Church. All parts of the question must be answered.

3. Early in the 16th century, Spanish explorers and conquistadors claimed much of the Americas. Why did the Spanish want to establish an empire in the Americas? What 2 Native American empires did the Spanish conqueror and how and why were they able to conquer them? All parts of the question must be answered.

TITLE:  Is it safe for me to dye my hair again after having it bleached?
BODY: Hi guys! I could really use your help.


So for the past 2 years I ve been going to Walmart and buying the Creame Of Nature bronze hair dye. My mother has been dying my hair up until now and has been doing a good job.
  
A month ago I was thinking of dying my hair a dark brown color ( my hair is black by the way) before my high school graduation (I m free!!). I was just going to go to Wal-Mart and get a different color but my mother suggested I go see a hair stylist. 

So the day before my graduation I went to see a hair stylist. I didn t bring a picture of what I want but I did say I wanted a dark brown. Soooo.... The lady must have thought that I said Dark Blonde! 

I looked like a skunk! ( I m also dark skinned....So yeah) 
I didn t realize until it was too late. Also I can be really shy and I didn t want to make the stylist feel bad ( and to make matters worse I knew who she was. We go to the same church) so I just sat there.

My mother was pissed off! She didn t yell, she just calmly asked if the stylist could fix my hair. So the lady put black dye all over my hair and made me sit for about 45 min. 

Safe to say it took six hours for my already black hair and a waste of $75. And I only had it straighten, which I could have done myself.

Now I want to dye it back to the dark red I had ( I ve even been thinking a dark blue) but someone told me I had to wait 6 months. Should I just leave it alone? Is there anyway to fix this?

TITLE:  Should the dentist have used the good tooth as a lever to remove the decayed tooth that was next to it?
BODY: Hi everyone!
My dad recently had an extraction during which the dentist inserted a sharp instrument between the decayed tooth and a good tooth in order to get the bad one out. Is that a common practice for extractions, i.e risking damage to the tooth next to it(by using it as a lever) to remove the bad tooth?
Thanks.

BODY: I had my braces taken off in the beginning of the month and was given three clear retainers.  I've been wearing my retainers 24/7 and only removing them when I eat but for some reason the top row of my teeth aren't straight like my sister's who also had her braces and retainers removed and given to her on the same day.  My two front teeth are fine but the 2-3 teeth away from the two middle teeth aren't straight, they moved and no one in my family believes me.  My orthodontist tells me that my retainers are fine and that they are working.

TITLE:  How to get my 9 year old cat to become tolerant of my new 12 week old kitten?
BODY: I recently adopted a new kitten. he is the sweetest little thing ever! but there's just one issue- my older cat ( who I absolutely adore), is not too happy about the kittens arrival. I did lots of research before getting the new kitten. my older cat really is not the nicest thing in the world.. only to the people she knows, but even then she's not very nice. I have had the kitten staying in another room and letting my older cat walk around the room when the kitten got to explore the other parts of my house. then, I put the kitten in a crate and opened my door to the older cat who is always lurking outside of the kittens room.  they first said hi and sniffed nosed until my older cat hissed and made a deep noise.. maybe it was growling? but then she stepped away from the kitten. I keep trying to slowly let my older cat get used to the kitten but she won't even approach the cage! I don't wanna force anything but I just don't know how I am supposed to get my cat to be accepting of the new kitten. 
also, I have a dog that is so sweet and would never harm the kitten BUT the kitten is quite terrified of her and keeps swiping at her, which is just scaring my dog. how do I fix that? my dog tries to go say hi to the kitten but he just tired to attack...
ANYWAYS, please if you have any advice on things I should and shouldn't do... LET ME KNOW!!! thanks.

BODY: Who the heck is Philly to claim Floyd's style as their's when Floyd and Toney is from Michigan??? B Hop n Danny Garcia is from Philly n they don't use the philly shell. 
The Chinese kung fu calls it the Snake's Fist Style n has used it for ages and i believe that it is a better name for the style, since a snake such, as a King Cobra, is slippery  and waits to counter strike and curls or wraps it's lower parts just like the style does to protect it's body. 
So should we drop the philly shell name n call it the snake's fist style instead, a slippery defensive counter attacking style?

So there's no confusion, brands are burns made by metal (may be other ways, I dont know) and it creates a symbol or picture in the skin like a tattoo, but more painful and not colorful and pretty.

BODY: I've been oil pulling for about 2 weeks with unrefined coconut oil. But I've noticed there is discoloration on my teeth and it's slightly yellow now. My teeth have always been pretty white, but now this is worrying me. It can't be the oil staining my teeth because it doesn't have a color and plus it's organic. I've continued to oil pull just in case it was a stage I just need to get past but I'm wondering has anyone else experienced this problem and does it change?

TITLE:  Color for a chestnut?
BODY: I know there are probably a million of these questions but anyways. I am going to order a new saddle pad to fit under my saddle better than what I have. But I'm torn on the color. My gelding is a chestnut Appaloosa, he has 4 high white socks, a big wide blaze, as well as a spotted hindquarters that extends to his withers, he also has a white spotted stomach. His original color I was going to use for him is blue, he looks good in it but I also have a fly bonnet that is hunter green and it looks cute on him. I also think burgundy would look cute on him. I want to eventually do jumpers with him, and I want a less bold color that is more reserved mostly because he is so loud him self with all of his white I don't need a bright saddle pad color to draw attention to us. I was going to order all 3 since they are half off but, I don't see why I would need ever single one and I need to buy other things as well as this saddle pad. 

I attached a picture of the saddle pad colors the blue I'm talking about is the more of a royal one, the hunter green is the 6th from the bottom, and the burgundy is second to last. My gelding is also more of a coppery penny type chestnut.

TITLE:  A black spot appeared on my tooth a few days ago, but I just went to the dentist two months ago (I had no cavities). Should I go back?
BODY: Is it possible they missed it the first time I was there? I know its a weird question but I had four wisdom teeth out a month ago, could that have caused a cavity somehow? I will call them and ask but I just want some advice first because I feel like it is too early to go back to the dentist.

TITLE:  I badly need ur help on this, Please analyze the poem below using three of the following literary theories: psychoanalysis, reader-response,?
BODY: The Taj, mayhap, to you may seem, a mark of love supreme
You may hold this beauteous vale in great esteem;
Yet, my love, meet me hence at some other place!
How odd for the poor folk to frequent royal resorts;
‘Tis strange that the amorous souls should tread the regal paths
Trodden once by mighty kings and their proud consorts.
Behind the facade of love my dear, you had better seen,
The marks of imperial might that herein lie screen'd
You who take delight in tombs of kings deceased,
Should have seen the hutments dark where you and I did wean.
Countless men in this world must have loved and gone,
Who would say their loves weren't truthful or strong?
But in the name of their loves, no memorial is raised
For they too, like you and me, belonged to the common throng.
These structures and sepulchres, these ramparts and forts,
These relics of the mighty dead are, in fact, no more
Than the cancerous tumours on the face of earth,
Fattened on our ancestor's very blood and bones.
They too must have loved, my love, whose hands had made,
This marble monument, nicely chiselled and shaped
But their dear ones lived and died, unhonoured, unknown,
None burnt even a taper on their lowly graves.
This bank of Jamuna, this edifice, these groves and lawns,
These carved walls and doors, arches and alcoves,
An emperor on the strength of wealth, Has played with us a cruel joke.
Meet me hence, my love, at some other place.

TITLE:  Why dose the front of my hair not grow but everything else is fine?
BODY: Hello, now i'm about 23 and I would think this shouldn't be a big deal but it seems like just the front of my hair is only growing too a certain length and then refusing to go any further. Iv tried different shampoos and products but nothing is working so could anyone suggest something that would give my hair its length again.

PS: This issue occurred about almost a year ago when i was excessively drying the front of my hair with a towel to the point it was hurting my scalp at times and i did not realize this until later so is it possible this had something to do with it? I have stopped drying but maybe my hair is damaged and needs repairs? Any suggestions for the same issue would be greatly appreciated.

BODY: So when I got my elastics ( about 3 weeks ago ) my mom found another pack on one of the chairs and decided to take it. And the doctor gave me two other packages with the correct size but I didn t know there were size differences so I used he wrong sized one without knowing. Now I randomly decided to see the tiger packages and well they were different sizes. The one I ve been using is thicker so it s actually making the progress faster since it was putting more pressure. Anyways, is this a problem? Did I screw up my jaw? Should I be worried ? My next appointment is 2 weeks.

TITLE:  Will I need braces again?
BODY: I got my wisdom teeth removed about 3 weeks ago. But my teeth are still very crooked and pushed forward. The pressure is gone however off my teeth and sinuses. 
I went to my ortho and he said to wear my bottom retainer all the time for 6 weeks. And my top one only at night. Problem is he made me a new retainer of my crooked teeth. They are nowhere near how they used to be, How will this make my teeth go back to being straight? 

How can I get my teeth straight again? I don't know what to do

TITLE:  What's the deal with the campaign against makeup shaming? Has anyone actually been shamed for wearing makeup?
BODY: I keep seeing things in my news feed on Facebook about girls who post pictures with makeup on only half of their face as a response to a YouTube video someone made about the power of makeup. I've never heard of anyone being shamed for wearing makeup by those who don't wear it. I am the only girl I know who doesn't wear makeup and I've never shamed anyone for wearing it. I've been shamed for not wearing it. I've been told that I have to wear makeup for dressy occasions because some people think it's a requirement for dressing up but I think I look best without it. I tried it once and it felt gross and I wanted it off, but I personally don't care if others use it or have fun with it.

TITLE:  How do I convince my mom to let me wear makeup?
BODY: I m 13, and I know that all of you are gonna say that I m young, but the only thing that I use is lip gloss, lipstick and chapsticks and she forbiddes me from dark colors like red, brown etc. like, they re only colors!! And she only let me put a little bit of eyeliner (she doesn t let me form a wing) and mascara ONLY on special occasions (weddings, graduation etc.)  I can t even wear them when I m in my friends house :( and the things that she NEVER let me use is eyeshadow, councelor and foundation and blusher.  I can t even fix my eyebrows! She tells me that I can t wear full makeup till I m 16 because she thinks I m too young. But she doesn t understand  how unfair it is for me to see all those girls my age wearing makeup and looking perfect also it doesn t really help that our generation s parents let their kids wear makeup that early and my parent s don t. It s so hard for me since a lot of girls ask me why I don t wear makeup that much and I answer to them that "my mom doesn t let me wear a lot" It s not like I m gonna turn into a drag queen, it s just a little bit to enhance my beauty and just boost my self esteem up. So how can I convince her?

TITLE:  Can i get restitution for what the British did to my people?
BODY: I live in Port Harcourt,Nigeria.A while ago i discovered my people originated from the Benin Kingdom or Benin Empire as it is popularly known. I became intrigued and wanted to know more about my people and so i went online and did a lot of research and found out a lot (but still limited) about my peoples culture and history. The Benin kingdom was a pre-colonial African empire that dates back all the way back to the eleventh century C.E. Turns out it's pretty impressive and i have a proud heritage. From stories I've heard they were pretty successful,had a well structured social hierarchy, were very good in trade, had unique culture art and weaponry and were very wealthy and had many resources (i think Gold was the most plentiful of them). I was proud and happy up to the point where i found out what the British did to them. Long story short the British wanted resources that they had and tricked them by striking a bargain with them, before they could realize what was going on it was to late and the British came and stole,raided,pillaged and destroyed them plus also stealing a lot of their cultural artifacts like the gold statues you see in the picture. Some of our older generations still remember remnants of tales that have been past down of the riches of the empire and the horrors and treachery of what the white men did. Here are links if you want to know more in detail

TITLE:  Hair dye left in heat?
BODY: So i ordered sparks hair color off amazon about a week ago and it came yesterday in the mail and i got it at about 5 or 6 pm (the mail usually comes at about 1 or so so say it was in the mailbox for 4-5 hours) I live in florida so it was in the mid to high 80's that day. The hair dye was in a box, and the box was in the standard usps packaging envelope. The envelope was not hot/warm neither was the box but the tube was warm. Not like burning, but warm. Is it still okay to use the dye? (The tubes are not warm now btw they cooled off in about 5 minutes of being in room temperature).

TITLE:  How to get rid of oily hair?
BODY: Ok so even like 4 hours after I wash my hair, it is greasy. I use good shampoo, like the kind salons use. And I wash regularly. But it always gets greasy so fast. I don t constantly run my fingers through it or anything. It just naturally gets that way no matter what I do. I do the apple cider vinegar thing, I only condition the ends, it s like I m doing everything I ve read but it s always greasy

BODY: When I don't straighten or curl my hair,  it curls up at the end  it's not straight,  and it's not way.  Personally,  I think I look like a guy who never cuts his hair.  I just don't want to totally kill my hair.  I've straightened my hair since the fifth grade. I'm in ninth now.  I've tried braiding before going to sleep,  my hair is frizzy when I take them.  I just don't know what to do.  Does anyone have any advice?

TITLE:  How to et cats from under a shes?
BODY: Ok so my grandad cat had kittens and they are under the shed they won't let anyone touch them. I have pet some of them before but all they do is hiss and run back under the shed. They are bout 2 months old. Is it to late for them to trust people, how can I get them to trust me, and how should I get them out from under the shed


I have tried laying food out and hiding behind this door by the shed till they come to eat and then pet them and that works the most but takes forever last time it took me 2 hours before 1 even stuck it's head out. I tried a trap with really smelly food inside but it didn't work the mom kept getting in the way. Any other ideas thanks

BODY: My hair is bleached, barely and has purple fading. I want to dye my hair bright orangey red for school but I need help because I've never dyed my whole head. I've heard that Manic Panic Red dyes don't work, but I've also heard other brands don't work either. Could someone give me a rundown on how to do this and what brand I should use. Or what color? I'm very pale, with light freckles, my hair goes down to my hips, my eyes are brown and my hair is a light yellowy blonde with the roots coming in a darker blonde. Thanks!

TITLE:  Need help with vectorizing photos in Photoshop plz?
BODY: I was just wondering how do you guys see the lines in the photos? Like in the hair?
I always get frustrated because I don't exactly know how to outline the shadows and the hair?
l'll zoom in but I get all confused and frastrated because i don't know how to outline the shadows and the hair/fly away hairs.
l
ike take this Selena Gomez photo for example:
https://s3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/ENTNDIVDfnUE48ODfZUzgQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/omg/2015-01-23/8da03470-a308-11e4-86fe-19b164bb4cb1_selena-gomez-haircut-instagram.png

How would I vectorize her? 

I'm a big time newbie at this but I'm really interested in vectorizing.
is there a way to put an effect on it to make it easier to see all the lines and shadow in the photo?
hope this makes sense. :/  
Thanks y'all :]

TITLE:  Makeup to go with prom dress- Tomboy SOS!!!?
BODY: I NEED HELP!
I am an incredibly pale person (so pale the lightest foundation I've found looks orange against my skin). I have a mix of dark brown and black hair thanks to a questionable dye job a while back. I have blue/grey/green eyes, depending on things like lighting (I'm assuming) and I have cool undertones.
My prom dress has a white top with a thick black waistband and a pale pink skirt.
I am a total tomboy and have never worn makeup in my life except for on Halloween and the occasional bit of mascara for parties.
Does anyone have any idea how I could do my makeup? Please help?
PS. Prom is tomorrow so please answer soon!

TITLE:  My cat is 17 years old and has hyperthyroidism. He's been on medication for it. He's still dropping weight and won't eat. Help please!?
BODY: Won't consume anything, but whole milk. Just sits there and stares at his food, but won't eat. For the longest time, he's been yowling obnoxiously like he's in pain, but the vet keeps telling us it's nothing. But it really doesn't sound like nothing, it sounds like he's in a lot of pain. But he'll stop doing it immediately if he sees me pop around the corner or something. So it's weird. He also has some minor digestion issues, but the meds he's on for that works really well. It's like a liquid we give him. The thyroid meds are just these little pink pills. He's dropping weight now though like crazy and it's breaking my heart to see him in this condition. Please help since the vet isn't giving us any straight up answers!!!

I'm always confused as to whether my hair is black or very dark brown. I've always believed that it is black but recently I've noticed that whenever I step into sunlight, there seems to be a slight brownish tint so I don't know.
As for my eye color, I always believed it was brown but again when I step into sunlight, I see them as a bit lighter like in the picture.

BODY: I was filming a clinic the other day and one of the horses spooked and threw in a massive buck that sent his rider flying.  She literally did a flip and landed on the top of her head.  Got back on after a few minutes.  Afterward I asked her if she was ok, and she said she could not understand why when she stood up that we were all at the other end of the arena.  We weren't.  We were standing right next to her.  I suggested she go to the er and be checked for a concussion.  She hit the ground so hard it literally cracked her helmet.  So, do you think it's really a good idea to "get right back on"...or do you think it's better to get back on the next day?

TITLE:  Should i cut my hair?
BODY: My hair length is a little bit below my chest area. I've learned to do a ton of fun braids with my hair, and i love to curl and straighten it, as well as learn cool new braids. But i have really bad dead ends from all of the heat i use on my hair, and i dyed the bottoms of my hair purple two weeks ago (its faded out now), and i'm kind of getting bored with my long hair. I find it to be a lot of work, but I once cut off my hair and i didn't like it. So do you think I should cut it to a little bit past my shoulders, or just trim off the dead ends and not use as much heat? May I remind you, that i am looking for a change, but not something SUPER drastic.

I like his style but I don't think I'm not that kinda type of a figher, because I'm usually known as a naturally strong person for someone who doesn't life or exercise a lot and one of my classmate told me if I bulked up and lost some weight I would have a similar body-type to Tyson... or that's what he thinks and he is one of the smartest people I know... also I  currently have a bad habit that makes my testosterone low and I thought if I stopped, I'll get stronger :)

TITLE:  Should I Cut My Hair Into A Pixie Cut?
BODY: I just want to know if you think i would look good with a pixie cut or something close to it. I had an awful bob cut my freshman year and I've had a hard time trying to imagine myself as "cute" with short hair. My boyfriend is telling me to go for it that I will look really good with it and my mom says I can pull it off but most girls who have it have thin faces and I don't have a thin face. I think I have an oval shape face with wide cheeks. I'm also about to start having to wear glasses soon and am going to be picking out my frames soon. Will that affect it? I just want to know if you think I would look good with a pixie. I'm so sick of my long hair and trying to manage it, plus it is freakishly thick and heavy and sweltering hot in the summer. So please tell me what you think and please don't say anything out right rude but I do want honest opinions. And if not a pixie cut, what would I look good with that would be shorter?

TITLE:  I badly need ur help on this, Please analyze the poem below using three of the literary theories: marxism, new criticism reader-respons,etc?
BODY: The Taj, mayhap, to you may seem, a mark of love supreme
You may hold this beauteous vale in great esteem;
Yet, my love, meet me hence at some other place!
How odd for the poor folk to frequent royal resorts;
‘Tis strange that the amorous souls should tread the regal paths
Trodden once by mighty kings and their proud consorts.
Behind the facade of love my dear, you had better seen,
The marks of imperial might that herein lie screen'd
You who take delight in tombs of kings deceased,
Should have seen the hutments dark where you and I did wean.
Countless men in this world must have loved and gone,
Who would say their loves weren't truthful or strong?
But in the name of their loves, no memorial is raised
For they too, like you and me, belonged to the common throng.
These structures and sepulchres, these ramparts and forts,
These relics of the mighty dead are, in fact, no more
Than the cancerous tumours on the face of earth,
Fattened on our ancestor's very blood and bones.
They too must have loved, my love, whose hands had made,
This marble monument, nicely chiselled and shaped
But their dear ones lived and died, unhonoured, unknown,
None burnt even a taper on their lowly graves.
This bank of Jamuna, this edifice, these groves and lawns,
These carved walls and doors, arches and alcoves,
An emperor on the strength of wealth, Has played with us a cruel joke.
Meet me hence, my love, at some other place.

TITLE:  Someone accidentally spat in my eye while talking and now my anxiety is through the roof. PLEASE help me?
BODY: She was talking and accidentally splattered right in my left eye. I immediately felt it and casually wiped off the excess and just smiled and continued the convo out of fear of mortifying her but inside I was freaking out.
It immediately began to burn (for unknown reasons) and the next day it felt sore all day. I had my contacts in during the incident and could only go home and remove them two hours later.

I have health anxiety and germaphobia and I KNOW how irrational my fears can be but knowing this doesn't help. At all.

First of all I'm so grossed out by the fact that her DNA got in my eye and seeped through my eye membrane and that it will alter me in some way (yes I know how ludicrous this sounds)

And second I keep freaking out over the possibility that her gums may have been bleeding and that some of that potentially HIV+ blood mixed with the saliva that got into my eye.

Please help me I'm going crazy over this

So they we're white, but born in Africa. Does that mean they could be identified as "African"? What do you think?

TITLE:  What was the lifestyle of Romani people in the early 1800s?
BODY: I have a project to do and I need some help. The Romani or "gypsy" people have always interested me. I hope I do not offend those who see this in anyway, but I do have some questions....
How did they act in 19th century? I'm curious. The Hunchback of Notre Dame portrays them as people who travel a lot and make money by dancing, stealing, etc.
What part of Europe did they mostly live around? Or was it everywhere?
Could they only speak their native language or were some able to speak English?
Were there ever any "gypsies" that quit being...gypsies?
What nations did not mind the Romani folk?
Anymore details or facts that you can help me with? Like what kind of clothes they wore and what their careers were - how they made money?

TITLE:  Why do people think NBA players are overpaid?
BODY: I'm serious. People always say police officers or fire fighters should be paid more. Think about why a doctor makes more than a fry cook at a fast food joint; the doctor has an in demand skill that draws in more money then flipping burgers, and it is less available. Now look at NBA players. They make their owners millions and only 60 people make it a year. This is not to mention all of the lifestyle changes, practice, pr, and traveling they have  to do. It's hard being a professional athlete, and that's because it's a full time job.

TITLE:  10 week old kitten gum problems, horrible breath, super skinny (eat s a lot though), and when she keeps it sounds horrible.?
BODY: I have a 10 week old kitten, she s all black. When we first got her she didn t appear sickly at all super shy but after a few days really friendly and playful. Now around 2nd 3rd month of having her? She s been on and off sick not so much playful but wanting to cuddle an awful lot, she has horrible breath, and I opened her mouth and on the bottom jaw between the two big teeth where her small teeth are supposed to be there s what appears to be inflamed yellow gum  s? But only in that area, she s also super skinny from what I can tell she eats a lot. From the first time we got her she wasn t as skinny as she is now... we could never feel her bones like we can now, you d swear she was starving but she s not I m always having to give her more food everyday. I don t know if this is normal or not I ve never had a sick cat like this before. Also when she meows is hoarse sounding almost or occasionally when she tries to nothing comes out? Is this normal or does it have something to do with her being sick? I ve looked up and tried doing research on some of this stuff only to come up with one thing that she has symptoms to is laryngitis. But I m not vet so I could be wrong on that. I know regardless I need to take her to the vet, but I m not exactly an adult yet an unable to take her myself. Just needing advice on this, whether or not I m overreacting on this or do I really need to be concerned? Help please?

TITLE:  How bad is my vision?
BODY: Unfortunately my vision sucks. It's so bad that there's a good possibility that I won't be able to get my driers license which is something that every 18 year old would want. I have had countless of surgeries and my prescription adjusted over and over again, but my vision has hardly improved. The thing I want to know is how bad is my vision? My doctor never really explained that to me, and when I look at my prescription paper, it's not the simple 20/20 or 20/40 that I'm used to seeing so I can't figure out how bad my vision is. I left an attachment of my prescription and I would greatly appreciate if someone could explain to me how bad my eyes are. Thank you :)

I'm not allowed to wear too much makeup. My mom might let me wear a bit more soon but for now only BB cream, Mascara, Eyebrow Filling, and neutral lipstick. I'm 5"3 so my height doesn't help. I might grow up soon since I have 8 - 8 1/2 size feet. Anyways, how can I look older and more mature, even how can I look prettier and more feminine as well? Thank you so much for your wonderful answers! ;)

Its barely layered, but still a bit layered due to a former cut which i recently trimmed....

So now it feels and looks very differently than when it had all those layers..

And im beginning to wonder if a layered haircut would be a good idea

My hair is past my waist.....so which would look better? 

Its also wavy (becomes curly-wavy the more layers i get) 

And its of great quality and very soft

TITLE:  Odd wound on my cats chest?
BODY: My cat is about two months old and is an indoor/outdoor cat. I recently noticed a little wound on her chest right by her left armpit. Yesterday it was just a bit bloody but today she washed herself and cleaned the area.

It appears to be a little hole and the skin around is red (probably from the blood) and tonight I held her to look at it. The little hole seems to have pulsing blood in it. Sometimes it is maybe a centimeter deep and other times half of a centimeter out. I tried to poke it, to see if it is blood, but nothing came off on my finger and it just retracted into her chest.

I looked around on Yahoo! Answers and it looks like a bug may have lain an egg in her skin. My dad and step-mom told me to keep an eye on it but now I m convinced it is a bug or larvae.

Should I remove it with tweezers or contact the vet? I feel like I could take it out myself but I'm not sure.

BODY: I went into a Great Clips and watched as a guy got his hair cut and then the next person set down and she cut her hair using the same comb and scissors that she used on the last person with out so much as wiping off the other persons hair. I remember when I was younger going to these places and seeing there equipment in a jar with blue liquid and they would always get a fresh one before cutting someone else hair. So is that not a thing anymore or is this place just not up to code?

TITLE:  Buzz Cut Length?
BODY: So tomorrow I am getting a haircut, and I have decided to get a buzz cut because it is very hot now. I haven't had a buzz cut since I was very little, so I don't remember it much. However, I do have pretty short blonde hair. I wasn't exactly sure what length to get, but I'm thinking about either a number 2, 3, or 4 on the top. Should I get the same length all around or just one length? What should those length(s) be? I also want to have it feel and look like a buzz cut, but not show much scalp. Also, I want it to feel very cool (temperature wise) because I play a lot of sports. I also don't want it to become of fuzzy and weird when I take a shower. If you have any pictures then that would be great.

She still has an appetite and goes back to eat. She doesn t seem sluggish or like anything is out of the ordinary. She used to occasionally throw up very infrequently, it is not normal for her to throw up this often.
I read about developing food allergies, should I switch food? Or just take her to vet? Please help

TITLE:  Do hair removal creams work good?
BODY: Hey, so i know there are a lot of posts about hair removal creams but most i have seen are years old. So im 18 years old (male), middle eastern, and i current have atleast a little hair on my entire body. The hair on my butt is the same length as the hair on my legs which are fairly long. I m not comfortable having people feel up my butt and shoot lasers (not to mention the cost of laser hair removal). so im wondering, do the current hair removal cream actually work permanently and how well. I dont really care about irritations, just results. I m looking to remove hair on most of my body except lower arms, lower legs and arm pits.

TITLE:  My husband and I took a drive thru order from Long Johns Silvers tonight for dinner, as I was finishing my fish I crunched down on something extremely hard, it cracked two of my teeth!?
BODY: I spit out the food immediately and found a shard of tooth as well as what looks like a rock or what may have been a fraction of a shell. I'm in pain, and it not only took out two fillings in the back of my molars, but also a chunk of two different teeth as well as ruffed up all of my back teeth edges. It hurts to talk now because of the scraping on the side of my tongue, and I cannot eat or drink anything hot nor cold now due to the sensitivity. I went to the resturaunt, spoke with a manager on the phone and they said they file a report and contact me. My teeth are broken and it's painful! What should I do?

TITLE:  Should I leave it to a professional to dye my ombre hair back to its original color?
BODY: A couple of months back, I decided to change my hair up completely, so I went for a very blonde ombré. I had a professional dye it since my hair is very dark, where it almost looks black. I don't like dying and damaging my hair multiple times to maintain a color which means I let My dark roots grow back for awhile. With my laziness in using products to maintain the color of the ombre, my hair has been getting lighter. I finally decided i was over the blonde and wanted to go back to my roots. The only thing is, since my natural hair is so dark, I don't know if I should pay for a professional  to dye it back for me  or if I should just buy a couple of boxes from the the store and do it at home. What would be the best thing to do? How many processes would this take?

TITLE:  Herbst Appliance?
BODY: Hello, I recently got my Herbst appliance 2 days ago and I have a few questions that hopefully someone can answer.

1. After I got the Herbst appliance placed in, I noticed my mid lines don't align any more. Will they align again once they remove the appliance or while the appliance is still on?
2. Also, my top and bottom front teeth touch when I bite down and my lower jaw sticks out more, making it look like I have an underbite when I don't. Will my lower jaw stick out like this from now on?
3. The Herbst appliance also pinches the sides of the inside of my mouth. Usually when I'm about to open my mouth to bite into something. Will it always pinch?
4. Finally, the back of my molars don't touch. Will they eventually touch? If so, how long until they'll touch again? I'm having a really hard time eating with only my front teeth.
~ If you guys have any tips or personal experiences you'd like to share I would be more than happy to hear them. ~

Thank you in advance.

BODY: Someone in my house put a bunch of wet towels in the bathroom sink. I don't know how, but my curling iron got wet. I keep my curling iron in a drawer attached to my sink. I wasn't planning on using it soon, but I was wondering is it still okay to use ever? Or do I have to get a new one? If it is still okay to use, how long do I have to wait until it's okay to use. I'm pretty sure no water got inside of it, and I dried it off thoroughly.

I had a filler before because I chipped my tooth and this dot is right above where the crack was so it is not part of the filling. It doesn't look like a cavity and it won't scrape off. I really don't want to go to the dentist. Also, I have not been experiencing any pain it just showed up out of the blue. What could this mean?

So i decided to buy the shimmer lights to see if that will take away the blonde and make it grey. I tried shampooing it like normal, and i tried leaving it in for as long as 40 minutes with no luck. Now im wondering if i dye my hair a pastel purple, will the shimmer lights help at all with maintaining the color since its a purple shampoo? Or will i just be wasting it?

I wish I was there, but I didn't even know this was a thing until it ended today and I saw some posts about it!! There was no prior notice, and I searched online on where to sign up for next year's camp and there were no places, just posts about old camps from previous years. I really want to go to a basketball camp hosted by Stephen Curry. If anyone knows anything about the details, please inform me! Is there a place where you can sign up, and what is the cost? Thanks!!!

TITLE:  Why does my fill in hurt at night?
BODY: I got a full in 3 days ago. The second night I woke up with pain. The pain kept me awake for a couple minutes but I eventually fell asleep. Now I am awake again and it is 2:18am. It is really hurting again. I don t think the fill in is to high so I don t think it s my teeth grinding. What do you think it could be?

TITLE:  Is this a good amount of makeup for an eight grader to wear?
BODY: I've strugged with insecurities for most of my life. I only wear makeup for myself not other people. I'm going into eighth grade and I was wondering if foundation, top eyeliner, blush, mascara, eyeshadow, and (not over the top) contour powder is okay. I make it look very natural and I look my age. A lot of other people in my grade wear no makeup at all. Do you think I should cut back on a few things or am I okay with this amount. Please no judgement. Thank you.

I could shave and it would be smooth but in a couple of hours it would feel sharp and prickly. I always bleed when I shave as well. I don't wanna have hair and I'm too shy to get a Brazilian wax. If I shave going down it doesn't get all the hair. I try getting new razors but they still cut me. Should I just have hair? Is that attractive?

We do not have an emergency vet in our area and have to wait until morning to take her. She has been so weak and hasn t moved around much. But she has been drinking a lot of water and just started grooming herself. Is that a good sign. Its really not looking like she will make it through the night I m just looking for any glimmer of hope.

I immediately felt pain and discomfort and washed my eye out in the sink. The pain subsided a few hours later but I noticed the vision in my right eye is slightly blurry. I can t read words   or make out specific things like numbers on a clock from a distance whereas my left eye does just fine. I have been putting in eye drops and it seems to be improving. Should I be concerned? I can see a few small ebrasions in the corner of my eye but they look fine.

Is overalls where offense F defense B- and potential C and at first I thought it was weird for STEVE NASH to have an F offense coaching rating but I thought it would get better as he gains more coaching experience but it's been 3 years into my mygm (2 with him as my coach) and his ratings haven't changed even tho I won a championship and made the playoffs both seasons. Do the ratings for coaches ever change? Or does it stay the same no matter how successful he is. Like if I were to pick the sixers and have them win the championship will Brett Browns ratings still be D's across or with they ever go up?

TITLE:  Can whitening teeth while wearing braces cause white spots?
BODY: Due to loss of enamel from baking soda and lemon juice? 

When I had my braces on I noticed a yellow spot on one of my teeth so I decided to do the baking soda mixed with lemon juice whitening method. I only did it twice and only did it on my top teeth. My teeth have never been sensitive but ever since I did it they are sensitive to hit &amp; cold foods/beverages and sweets.

Like 2 or 3 months later I got my braces off &amp; had really bad white spots on my top teeth (none what so ever on bottom). I ve always brushed really well and taken good care of my teeth when I had my braces on. My dentist told me she could tell I take really good care of my teeth (when I had my braces) and then my next appointment after I got them off she was basically bashing me telling me how horrible my teeth were and that I should have taken better care of them when I had my braces on it actually made me want to cry.

My question is, is it possible that me whitening my teeth with the baking soda &amp; lemon juice ruined my teeth? Or was it my that I didn t take good enough care of my teeth? I didn t tell my dentist or my orthodontist about the whitening, maybe I should have

TITLE:  Questions about the Voice by Thomas Hardy?
BODY: Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me,
Saying that now you are not as you were
When you had changed from the one who was all to me,
But as at first, when our day was fair.

Can it be you that I hear? Let me view you, then,
Standing as when I drew near to the town
Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then,
Even to the original air-blue gown!

Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness
Travelling across the wet mead to me here,
You being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness,
Heard no more again far or near?

      Thus I; faltering forward,
      Leaves around me falling,
Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward,
      And the woman calling.

Our teacher gave us 7 questions of which I answered 3,but I cannot understand the other 4.Please can you help me out?

q4)How would you describe the time frame of the poem?how do different moments in time(present,recent,past,distant past(whats distant past)) play out in the poem?

q5) Does the speaker figure out how to mourn for someone he no longer loves?Is there a solution to this problem in the poem?
q6) what is the effect of the poem's rhymes and meters on its content?9What are rhymes and meters by the way)
q7)Why do think the poem changes it's form in the last stanza?(what is a form?) Please help me ppl I really need help,I never used to be this bad at literature just one year gap from studies has made me a fool.

TITLE:  Terrible experience at a salon I need help please?
BODY: before I went to the salon my hair was really long and I did dye it myself. I am 15 years old and my family does not have much money. so box dye was the option. 
but now my mom finally agreed that I can dye my hair at a salon. I was really excited. I went to this lady and she cuts my brothers hair all the times. I have to admit, she can cut hair very well, but dying peoples hair is terrible. I wanted balyage and I even showed her pictures of how I wanted it to look. so she dyes my hair and she gave me highlights not balayge, huge problem the roots of my hair were yellow highlights, yellow. my hair looks terrible. and I do have dark hair I wasted $120 down the drain. she said to come Friday to she can fix it, but I am not trusting her. my natural hair is really really dark. so my roots are growing out from the previous dying my own hair. I don t even think she put toner in my hair. i am no expert on hair but I do know the way she dyed my hair was not right. and I can not afford to go to another salon and fix it. so I went to go buy hair dye at the drugstore hoping I can fix it myself. it still looks bad but 10 times better then what the lady did to my hair. I do not know what to do and I am so insecure about my hair and Ik it s just hair but it s yellow orange streakes. and I don t have enough money to go fix it at s salon. what should I do?

BODY: I finally got my mom to let me get highlights, so my mom found a stylist who had a good deal. We went there, and she did not asked me what color highlights I wanted. Normally, they open this book and ask me to select a shade, but she didn t.  I asked her or a more naturally look, because my hair is like medium brown. She did everything and when it was time to wash it off my hair was really light blonde, I was not happy with us, so she put toner on it.  After it was all over she blowed dried it, and I thought I liked it, last night. But, today as I look at it, I can t help but hate it. It looks so unnatural, my mom says it looks nice however I cannot stand it. What can I do to fix it? Is it safe to go to a salon and get my hair dyed to my natural hair color again?

TITLE:  How do I get my cats to get along?
BODY: I had two cats, a boy and a girl, and we've had them for about 10 months. The other day we got a new male kitten, only 3 and a half weeks old. My older male cat was, at first, very wary of the kitten and even hissed at him, but is now very loving towards him and even cleans him. My female cat, however, growls when the kitten gets near and will swat at him. You'd think she would just ignore him, but she always watches his interactions, gets close, then gets upset and growls until I make her leave. How can I get her to get along with the kitten?

BODY: My horse suffered from impact colic last year, it was quite a bad case and he had to stay at the vets for two nights. 
He didn t really show any symptoms until it got really bad he was still eating as normal the day ect.. But the other week I noticed him  struggling  to go to the toilet he was still eating his hay and feed as usual and seemed himself still so I just kept an eye on him and he seems to be fine. Is there anything I can feed to try and prevent him from colic again? He s currently fed on cherry chaff, garlic,magnesium &amp; a tiny bit of sunflower oil (just started the oil recently).  Thanks in advance.

BODY: The Poet War Paint


Can we settle the war?
War painted in our faces,
We dreamed in colors
We all have enemies
Our gift can be targetted
But we can't use it for evil,
Breaking every edges
Everyone would battle
Hate is a strong word
The wind changes,
So does our life changes
Our time comes to an end
We start battling fellow poets
We all need to get along
Get over our prides,
It's time to change now
The pen changes the skies,
It have miracles now
When life becomes grey
We battle across the night,
I know we are poets
Let's start building
friendships.
Put your sword down
We don't start a fight,
Every day words changes
Flow out of our pen,
Our war paint reveal us
But let's stop the fight
Let's stop the madness
Unite as one group of poets.
Our scars reveal the truth,
We shouldn't start a crime
We are poets united as one.

TITLE:  How to make horseback riding as vegan as possible?
BODY: I've ridden horses all of my life and a couple months ago I adopted a rescue mare. She was beaten by her old owners and has scars from them across her flank and rear end. I've been going slow with her (she's also green, only five years old) and have been riding the most 'vegan' way possible. I have a vegan dressage saddle that fits her well and a bitless bridle. There's a chiropractor that specializes in horses (though she has made other disabled animals, like dogs in wheel chairs, able to walk again), a large animal vet my trainer uses for her 75,000 dollar show horses, and a farrier who shoes horses that compete in the rolex competitions. She gets shoed every three months like the rest of the horses at the barn. I don't use whips or spurs on her, always use fly spray, all that stuff. I ride her a couple times a week, maybe four, tops and only for one hour to an hour and a half each time. I ride at a very upscale barn, my trainer is riding in the Arabian Nationals in the next couple months and there are two vegetarians and another vegan that rides at the barn because they've never been somewhere where the horses are treated so well. 

I know horse back riding isn't vegan, but I would like to make it as ethical as possible with my horse, Brandi. She's very sweet and I don't want to hurt her at all.

TITLE:  Feet are flopping while riding?
BODY: Idk why but my feet are so floppy when I ride. (I ride western btw.) my trainer tells me to put more weight in the stirrups but if I put anymore weight I'm going to be standing up! We lengthened the stirrups which helped quite a bit but it's still not perfect. I almost lose my stirrup every time I lope. It doesn't matter how hard I focus on keeping my legs still, they still just flop around. Maybe I need to build more leg muscles? I guess it's one of those things I'll get with time but any tips or advice?

Is this a huge problem? Will my front teeth  be pushed forward by my back teeth and result in them sticking out much more than they do now?

It currently just feels a bit wrong when I bite down because my bottom teeth hit the back of my front teeth instead of the tip. Is this normal?

I know that I have to wait at least a weak befor I can wash it as it can reverse the effects of the relaxer however I thought that I could use dry shampoo in my hair as it isn't water but I am not sure. Also if anyone knows any other ways to remove grease from my hair without washing it that would be great. Thanks .

TITLE:  Boxing: give me 10 reasons why you love the sport of boxing!?
BODY: Me I love it because to me:
1. The variety of styles in it are unique
2. Has a bitter sweet culture that follows since it became popular.
3. The skill set and movement are much more convenient for the human brain to follow 
4. Never too late to box you still can become a champ even if you started boxing at a later age. 
5. Gives people a chance to prove themselves 
6. It bears the resemblance to life, cause just like life you're ought to fight it alone with nothing but advices from the corner
7. Discipline alone won't work without skills, skills alone won't work without the heart and do on.
8. Boxers often calculates each movement and execute everything with reasons. (Chess games) in 
9. Seeing punches landing are more fun than kicking and grappling like a girl.
10. Learning the logic of switching angles throwing different kinds of jabs, crosses, hooks, fighting in the inside are way more fun than grappling and kicking.

TITLE:  Pressed powder help!!?
BODY: ok so my mom wont let me wear pressed powder and im 13 and going into 8th grade! so many people in my grade and younger wear all sorts of makeup and im only allowed clear lipgloss! I asked her why and she said "because i said so!" and then i told her that its not nad for your skin and that if it has to much pigmentation i wont use it and she said "if you keed bugging me about this im taking your phone!" I personally think this is stupid because a couple days ago i asked her for this clear elf mascara and she said no and to ask my dad. I asked my dad he said to buy it so he can see if he likes it or not. And im suggesting the same thing with this just my mom keeps saying no! Should i go behind my parents back and buy it? or should i beg and plead to my dad to let me buy it? My dad's strict about makeup too but not as strict as he has had 3 daughters (my half sisters who are older than me) and im my moms first and shes way to overprotective of my and my dads way more layed back. So what should i do?

TITLE:  Why are Imperial Japan's war atrocities never mentioned,and displayed at the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC?
BODY: Imperial Japan committed as many genocidal crimes as Nazi Germany, so why is it forgotten, when there seems to be clear proof. It just baffled me that the Nanking massacre was nowhere to be seen at the museum! I would think there would be outrage and resentment from the Chinese American community?

Since it seems most steppe nomads used yurts (ger), is this true of the Magyars? Did they use some other form of dwelling? Do we just not know?

TITLE:  Cat not drinking?
BODY: I noticed recently that I haven't seen my cat drink lately.
Two days ago I watched her like a hawk, noting what she did and such, but I couldn't watch her when I was asleep or using the restroom. I didn't see her drink from her bowl at all, even though it was clean and fresh. I put an icecube in but she care.
The next morning it looked a little emptier, but it could have just evaporated. I noted my fishtank hadn't had any water dissappear from it though.
Yesterday we spent the day offering her a lot of different bowls and drinks. Room temp, chilled, iced, with a little bit of chicken broth, in plastic bowls, glass, clear, etc etc. She drank a little of the chicken broth but not much.
Today I offered her a tiny cup of watered down milk. She loves milk, always tries to drink it out of my bowl when I'm eating, but she didn't touch the one I set out for her yet.
She checked the bowl out but went about her business.

She's acting completely normal otherwise. Using the restroom as normal, eating normal, acting normal, but I'm still really worried about her. I know she gets moister from her wet food. 1 can a day (with dry food out for her to eat too) and I usually get her the gravey/saucy ones, but I think she should be drinking too.
We're going to take her to the vet tomorrow unless she takes a turn for the worse/better.

I have hope maybe she's just drinking when I'm asleep since she's acting completely normal otherwise. What should I look out for/do to help encourage drinking?

TITLE:  How can my cat lose weight (read description!!)?
BODY: First off I HAVE ALREADY been to a vet!

I  am sorry but I'm sick of the animal abuse comments about how dare I not see a vet when my cat is perfectly healthy, shows no signs of discomfort, spoiled, and fat.

The vet told me to reduce rations. The vet informed me that other than his weight he is perfectly healthy.

I have a male cat that was nuetered and has steadily gained weight. That is all.

The reduced rations aren't working because he continuesly steals food from the underweight cat, eats fish food, and literally claws open unoped bags. He does this even when his bowl is half full.

We have tried to keep all of these from him but to no avail. The vet said the fish food (that we have never given to him, he has just stolen) while not recommended, was not harmful. My cat simply finds stuff to get into. Like I've said he does this even when he has food.

One of the MAIN problems is when I try to feed him healthier wet food he goes on hunger strikes and goes without eating until we finally break and give him dry. I have tried three different brands of wet, some of wich he used to like, but it is no good. 

Hopefully I can get him skinnier with a harness walking over some more time but right now I need help with his eating!

BODY: OK so here's the thing when I was transitioning for relex to natural hair. I straighten it a lot I know that it's heat damage over the past year its gotten a lot better. The back part of my hair is very curly while the front is wavy/straight. I was very aggravated so I decided to to cut the front part of my hair into bangs. It help out a lot I was able to achieve a lot of styles easier. The front right side of my hair  has some curl to it since I don't straighten it as much. But the left front side is still wavy some times I want to wear a wash and go. But I can't because I have three different curl patterns in my head. I've been thinking about cutting the left side almost bald or trimming it down really low. Which would look better?

TITLE:  GTX 960 Dual Monitor Help! HDMI and VGA Monitors!?
BODY: Ok so I bought a new PC with a GTX 960 and it has a HDMI and a DVI port no VGA. I have a samsung TV with a HDMI input port and an old dell monitor with a VGA input port and was wondering how can I connect them both. This is what I was thinking basically I have a DVI (F) to VGA (M) adapter and was wondering would this work if I attatch the adapter VGA (M) side to the VGA Input monitor and then since its connected to a DVI (F) buy a DVI cable and attach a DVI to that side and connect it to the GTX 960. Then use a HDMI cable to connect the gtx 960 and the samsung TV would that work? Please help and Thanks.

BODY: His eyes were blue now they're getting slightly darker, maybe gray. It ate the fish I gave it and he loved it. I will give it back to its mother, but how do I ever get it used to me? Will it remember and recognize me? Once I put it back outside it will grow older and probably become more aggressive and harder to catch because it will learn how to jump from the patio where the mama cat eats. They're too scared for me to pet them even though they are fed.

TITLE:  Does chewing on one side affect the other side of the jaw?
BODY: I've made it a point to chew a lot of gum on the left side of my mouth because the left side of my face is weaker than the right (jaw and cheek muscles). However, what I've noticed is that the right side of my face continues to become more angular and the cheek muscles raises higher up progressively each week, yet the left side of my face has barely changed at all, a little stronger yes but with all the chewing I've done it should be much stronger. So this has led me to believe that chewing on one side of your face actually more affects the other. I actually switched to my right side yesterday and found that the right side of my mouth fatigued very quickly chewing, while my left side obviously didn't since I've been mainly using it for so long. So does anyone know why this is, do are jaw muscles work diagonally or something?

TITLE:  My horse wants to follow the moving herd.?
BODY: I recently bought a 6 yr old gelding who is a project horse. I've been riding and owning horses for 7 years so I have experience but one thing about him I cannot figure out, he wants to follow the moving herd.  For example, my daughter and I took him and our mare on a trail ride over the weekend. We met with some friends and took off for a 12 mile ride, about half way threw we came across a group of riders. We pulled off to the side in a fairly clear area of brush and allowed them to pass. My gelding quickly turned and followed them and it took much effort to get him back to the group he's been with for hours. The other riders weren't heading back to camp and non of them even meet my gelding. Also the area we stopped in didn't have any itch weed or harmful plants. This happend multiple times during the weekend and I haven't found out why he's doing this. He stays with our group if we're the one who keeps going and doesn't pull over when we come across another riders. He does have a problem with finding friends in the pasture and has human trust issues do to the previous owner but this doesn't solve the problem. I'll appreciate all the help I can get! Thanks.

TITLE:  What are some nontoxic scents to repel cats?
BODY: I'm getting a new cat named Shadow, and I'm afraid of her spraying. I'm trying to find a nontoxic scent to keep her from certain areas. All scents I've found that cats hate are toxic to them, whether its inhaling, consuming or just touching them, it apparently harms them. I'm completely lost, and I'd appreciate it if someone could help give me some advice to keep her from certain areas without harming her AT ALL. My mom would prefer using a scent, as she is very picky about how her house looks.

But the lady at the counter said that she couldn't process the return for me because when I bought it, I had returned to them a lipstick, and then paid the difference. She said that she couldn't give me a refund because this was the second exchange. I've never heard of this rule or read about it anywhere in MAC's return policy. Does anyone know if this is actually the case?

BODY: my hair is extremely curly, and whenever i wake up, it turns into this tangled mess. i hate combing it because it takes like 30 minutes to untangle it, even with this detangling spray that's supposed to work really well, and then 5 minutes later it gets tangled again! i wash it well, and i've gone through hundreds of wikihows, youtube videos, websites, etc. for my hair, and none of them are working. my hair is disgusting, tangly, sticky, frizzy, and my sisters and some kids at school are making fun of me for it. i tried taking care of it but it's just not working. My sister has the most beautiful, long, soft hair i've ever seen. She doesn't even have to comb it in the morning if she didn't want to because it's just natrually pretty. I want pretty hair like hers!

I'm thinking about just giving up on my disgusting hair and just chopping it all off! I need tips please! :(

TITLE:  Cosmetic contact lenses: Can I still wear my cosmetic contact lenses even if I haven't worn them in months?(and I wore them just 3 times)?
BODY: I haven't worn my cosmetic contact lenses in almost a year (I have them since December 2013, and the last time I put them on was on July or maybe June 2014), (and I have just put them on just 3 times, since I got them) and I don't know if I can use them now. I have always kept them in a multi-purpose solution for soft contacts, but I don't really change the solution in the cases very often, I do it once in a while, but not very often. Is there a way to tell if they're still in conditions to be worn?, Does not wearing them for a long time rise the chances of me getting an eye infection? Also, I didn't consult with an ophthalmologist about the cosmetic lenses, I have worn them some times before, and well, I don't seem to have been affected by them, but now I'm worried because it's been months since I last wore them. Is there something else I could do to them to clean them better? or should I not wear them again? (again: They are not for improving vision, they are red and they are for like costume/cosplay purposes)

I am a 15 year old black female, and I even resorted to washing my hair every day for a short period, but to no avail. Does anyone know what could be causing this?? Does anyone know how to make this smell go away?

TITLE:  HELP: Teeth don't touch after braces!?
BODY: Hi there! So I got braces about 6 days ago and to correct my cross bite, the dentist put two balls of some sort of filling material behind my front teeth so that I won't bite down on my braces. But none of the teeth in my mouth touch now I can only MAKE my front tooth touch my bottom tooth. There is no way to chew/eat anything solid so I've been living off water and soup for the past 5 days and probably today too. 

I called the dentist and he initially said that my teeth would meet in 1 week which is absolutely bullshit and his assistant later said that I would learn to chew in one week which is not possible because I cannot chew with only one point in my mouth I can only nibble. Besides 1 week is almost over. I'm 5'3 and was 92lbs, but now I'm 88lbs. 

Any advice on what I should do next? Or if you have had a similar experience? Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks for reading!

TITLE:  Can I get a refund of the eye exam cost if contacts don't work for me?
BODY: I recently visited an optometrist located in a Wal-Mart store. I paid a little over a hundred dollars for the eye exam (for contact lenses). This is not my first time getting contact lenses. I have worn them before but I stopped wearing them and decided to wear glasses for a few years. 
Now, I wanted to wear contact lenses again so I went through the eye exam with the optometrist and received a trial pair to see if they are comfortable and clear.
I did not find the trial pair(Acuvue) comfortable, so I was given another pair of a different brand(Air Optix). The different brand didn't work for me. I went to the optometrist Again, and was given Another trial pair (Focus Dailies). I'm wearing these now, and I don't think these are the right ones for me.
I suffer from having very dry eyes so I'm slowly realizing that I should just give up on contact lenses.
If none of the contacts the optometrist offers work for me, could I get a refund of the eye exam (for contact lenses)? If I can't find the right contact lenses, the prescription that I got from this eye exam becomes useless... :(

BODY: I don't know how he got it, he's 5 years old. I think the infection was due to him being in a pool or something contaminated. But anyway. His eyes are swollen a little and there's like this yellowy/grey-ish puss coming out of them every now and again. I'm scared that he might not be able to open his eyes if the stuff dries off, so we clean it with wipes. My mom is taking him to the doctor tomorrow but I would like an answer to know what this is and the best treatment just in case. Please

TITLE:  Any opinions on my poem and what i need to improve?
BODY: Torn

I thought it was yesterday
Everything felt so good,
Now I cannot breathe
I'm alone middle of the night


Now watching the stars
I know you were part of me,
My dreams slowly fades
Clouds turning into black

Rain drips blood in the sky
I can't stand the pain now
And I'm feeling hopeless,
In a horrible nightmare.

All drowning in tears,
We were strong together
But the tidal waves wash us
I was swept away from you

And my heart is breaking,
Here I am crying in pain
I screamed and shout,
I fall into the dark woods
My clothes are torn apart

Dirt all over me, scratches of
my skin
I heard church bells banging
I walked in and saw you,
Thought it wasn't a dream

I see you in a white dress
You're with a guy kissing him
I was standing there,
With my jaw opened

I punched the preacher and
destroyed all the tables
tears flooded my eyes
I am torn inside.

I don't want to break down
And cry to you,
But feeling angry inside,
I thought she was my baby
But shes killing me now,

I'm on the ground
Trying to get over my tears
Wait until I die,
Suicide is my option 
never live again.

TITLE:  Why is my hair falling out?
BODY: I am a 31 year old female who has always had pretty thick red hair. It is straight and dense. Lately though, it has been coming out in clumps. There is a trail of hair everywhere I go. I had a baby six months ago, but I don't think that is the reason for it because I have lost way more hair than I gained during pregnancy. My hormone levels are already back to normal, I have had my period for four months and I am still taking pre natals and iron. I am breast feeding. 

I have been using a new shampoo- TGI Catwalk- but the internet says that is not it. I have never had thyroid issues and I don't have a history of hair loss in my family. 

I have had periods of hair loss in the past, but never this drastic. I can't even use my normal hair ties now. I am starting to get my first signs of grey hair coming in in the front, and I haven't had a cut since before the baby. 

Im in decent shape, and I eat fairly well. I don't take any medications and I don't smoke. I'm stumped. Please let me know if you have any insight. Thanks.

TITLE:  What products should I use in addition to MTG to grow hair faster and healthily?
BODY: I'm a 15 year old African male who is trying to grow Afro hair fast. I understand that I cannot make it tall all at once, but I would still like to use the most helpful products. I've been looking online and as I have read, it seems MTG is the best for fast hair growth (feel free to recommend anything else if you think different). I would like to know what other products ( moisturizer, shampoo etc.) I should use to promote the growth of my hair, but also want to make sure that I use things that will not harm my hair too much. Would be very helpful to hear suggestions and comments, and am open to anything. Thank you.

TITLE:  When boxing how do I counter somebody rushing in.?
BODY: Hi. All my life I've been a boxing fan and from a more ghetto neighborhood,so in my neighborhood when I was younger(5th-8th) all we did everyday was put on the boxing gloves or actually fight. I've never lost ever. Luckily I was blessed with speed and good reflexes and watching boxing all my life, I picked things up naturally. I'm a little older now. (Freshmen in college) and its summer so we're all boxing again (fun and games and safely) . I boxed last night and I won both my fights. But I had a difficulty my 2nd won because I was so rusty. The guy came in wild but just firing punches. Luckily I was able to dodge and catch him. My question is sometimes there's people who come in and just throw punches wildly, but they're fast and hard. My question is how do I defend that because you can't always just back out and run "not literally run" but what's the correct way to fight a style like that?

TITLE:  IS MY CAT DEPRESSED?
BODY: I don t think my cat acts like the other acts I ve had in the past. 
The cats I ve had in the past were cuddly, nice and happy? Idk, but the cat I have now is aggressive, hostile, and she tries to avoid me and my dad. 
For example, we would be sitting in the living room, and she would sit in the dining room under the table, for hours on end. Setmes I would sit under the table with her, but I don t think she likes my company. 
Sometimes, when I m sleeping on the couch, she will come up and lay on me, or beside me, but I think she just does that for warmth. And she also only comes up to one of us if we re in the kitchen and she wants like turkey or 
Canned cat food. 
Whenever me and my dad pet her, or something, she always growls and hisses at us like we re gonna do something bad. 
Yeah, most of the time my dad plays rough with her, and I do sometimes, but the rest of the time I just wanna sit there and hold the cat without her TEARING MY ARM OFF. My cat is 6, I think. I don t know if that would help figure anything out or not. 

DOES SHE HATE ME??? How can I get her to be happy and like me? Is she depressed?? I mean, she eats normally, unless my dad gives her ham or canned cat food. 
She lost one pound, not recently I don t believe, because the vet said she had to lose some weight. I don t know. 

Help me, guys???? :(

TITLE:  Nobody agrees on the color of my eyes, why?
BODY: I've always been told that I have pretty or interesting eyes (yes someone actually said I have interesting eyes, I'm not kidding)(by family, girls, etc.). However, nobody agrees on what color they are, I've been told that my eyes are hazel, blue, green, and grey. I've noticed that it depends on the lighting. In my bathroom where the light is slightly yellow-orange my eyes to me look green, however when I look at a mirror outside on a cloudy day (where the entire sky is white/grey and its not actually dark outside) my eyes will be a brilliant blue. Now I would have come to the conclusion of "oh well must depend on the light", except I have had people say my eyes look green, blue, grey, hazel, all in the same room at the same time. What's up with that? I want to know the scientific reasoning behind this, why do different people see my eyes as a different color? I'm not asking what color my eyes are, just why people see them as a different color. Although if it's a certain color that makes people see my eyes differently then id like to know that

TITLE:  What's a good name for a kitten?
BODY: So today two of my brothers and my mom went to a race, and on their way back they saw a "free kittens" sign. My mum says we can get two- one for my brother, one for me.

I've never seen these kittens before, and I have no clue what they looks like/if they're male or female, so if you're going to please suggest names keeping that in mind.

I don't need advice about cats by the way, I've had cats ever since I could remember, and right now I have 7 (they are outdoor cats, they come and go inside as they please, and we have 6 acres of land, so considering all that it's not much. Also, YES we pay for them all) so I just would really like some name suggestions!

BODY: Arson was determined to be the cause of at least three of these fires. David A. Love at Atlanta Blackstar writes:
As the nation grapples with the massacre at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., one of the oldest Black churches in the South, other Black churches have become recent targets of arson.

From slavery and the days of Jim Crow through the civil rights movement and beyond, white supremacists have targeted the Black church because of its importance as a pillar of the Black community, the center for leadership and institution building, education, social and political development and organizing to fight oppression. Strike at the Black church, and you strike at the heart of Black American life.

TITLE:  My cat is a bird serial killer...?
BODY: So a bird made a nest in our holly bush and last week we found a dead toad on the lawn. The next day a dead bird. Yesterday.... another dead bird. Today I pulled up to my house just in time to hear a bird squawking and I ran over to my cat he was near the bush pinning down a baby bird with his paw and he picked it up in his mouth and I pushed it away from him and put him in the house. When I went back out a second later to check on the bird it was gone. The holly bush is too thick to see the nest now and I'm pretty sure the bird on the lawn the other day was their mother. What should i do? It's very hard to keep my cat inside because my mom always let's him out she never pays attention to the cats they're too quick for her. Advice? Thank you

TITLE:  The tone of this poem?
BODY: what is the tone of this poem , "Frederick Douglass" written by Robert Hayden 

When it is finally ours, this freedom, this liberty, this beautiful
and terrible thing, needful to man as air,   
usable as earth; when it belongs at last to all,   
when it is truly instinct, brain matter, diastole, systole,   
reflex action; when it is finally won; when it is more   
than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians:   
this man, this Douglass, this former slave, this *****   
beaten to his knees, exiled, visioning a world   
where none is lonely, none hunted, alien,   
this man, superb in love and logic, this man   
shall be remembered. Oh, not with statues’ rhetoric,   
not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone,
but with the lives grown out of his life, the lives   
fleshing his dream of the beautiful, needful thing.

TITLE:  Please help!!- dry socket?!?
BODY: I'm 17 years old and I got 4 wisdom teeth taken out exactly 1 week ago. there was normal pain/healing the first 4 days and then I began to feel better. I was still taking my medicine as needed and eating soft foods. day 5 I felt fine and was even beginning to eat more foods. day 6 I began having this sudden pain in my jaw that radiated to my ears and would cause a headache. now, day 7 it's a constant pain. I've followed all rules- no straws, salt water rinses, etc. day 4 and 5 were when my lower stitches came out. also my breath was very bad days 3-5. I have not had any blood clots come out, that I know of. the top stitches are still in. could this be dry socket?! It doesn't really feel like the backs are big holes like people say. do you think it's just taking a while to fully heal? Im going to call the oral surgeon tomorrow to see but Im too worried to wait so that's why I'm here. I know this is all jumbled and horribly written, I'm just worried! by the way, I've been taking penicillin and ibuprofen every 6 hours since I got my teeth removed. I've taken the pain medication when needed. any help is appreciated.

TITLE:  Scar left on head after injury from 7 years ago, what are my options ?
BODY: Hello Yahoo,

About 7 years ago I had a rough blow to the back of my head which busted it and sort of left a lump on the back of my head with a smooth scar. Obviously hair hasn't grown back since 7 years and I'm curious to see what my options are now to do something about it since it's 2015. I've heard of hair transplant but the scar is not really large enough in my opinion to require hair transplant  as I feel its only the size of a nickel  or a bit larger but not a quarter. I don't really want to do hair transplant either, just uncomfortable with the idea. In my mind, I imagine a procedure occuring where the cut out the scar tissue and restitch the skin which would "resize" the scar to a much smaller, thin line that would barely be noticeable with the hair cut low. What are some common surgeries in this day and age? What would you reccomend?

Here are two pictures of the scar.

Please refrain from telling me to grow with it and don't be so insecure.



Thanks !

BODY: So its been a good 2 months since I've dyed my hair black and blue. The black is now more dark brown and the blue super light. I have only bleached my hair twice in all the times I've changed the color so it has no split ends and is still considerably healthy. I'm now wanting to go a pastel pink, how would I do this with little damage?

TITLE:  Had an abscessed tooth pulled?
BODY: I have had a bad tooth for about 3 years that caused me on and off. the pain was terrible so I buckled down and went to my dentist.  They said the tooth was abscessed and my options were to get the tooth pulled that day with the risks of numbing medicine not working very well, or get a prescription for antibiotics and then come back and have it pulled. Well i figured deal with pain for the duration of having the tooth pulled and have some soreness for a couple of days and be home free. Well they pulled the tooth, and it was terrible. When the dentist finally got it out you could literally smell the infection and see the puss on the root of the tooth after they had pulled it out. Well they packed the area with gauze and sent me on my way telling me to take tylenol or ibuprofen for the discomfort. The pain afterwards was terrible, a little more painful than when the tooth was in there. Got some ice and took some ibuprofen and took a nap. Woke up with no pain and went to work (sitting in an office) well at the end of my work day my face had swelled up and was painful. Sucked it up and went to bed,  well I just woke up still very swollen and the outside of my face is extremely tender along with the pain in the actual area. I've tried the ice and keeping my head elevated. I know it's supposed to be sore, but is it supposed to be excruciating pain worse than when the tooth was in there? could this be because the tooth was infected and the infection is still there? I'm going crazy.

TITLE:  The Voice by Thomas Hardy?
BODY: Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me, 
Saying that now you are not as you were 
When you had changed from the one who was all to me, 
But as at first, when our day was fair. 

Can it be you that I hear? Let me view you, then, 
Standing as when I drew near to the town 
Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then, 
Even to the original air-blue gown! 

Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness 
Travelling across the wet mead to me here, 
You being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness, 
Heard no more again far or near? 

Thus I; faltering forward, 
Leaves around me falling, 
Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward, 
And the woman calling. 

Our teacher gave us 7 questions of which I answered 3,but I cannot understand the other 4.Please can you help me out? 

q4)How would you describe the time frame of the poem?how do different moments in time(present,recent,past,distant past(whats distant past)) play out in the poem? 

q5) Does the speaker figure out how to mourn for someone he no longer loves?Is there a solution to this problem in the poem? 
q6) what is the effect of the poem's rhymes and meters on its content?9What are rhymes and meters by the way) 
q7)Why do think the poem changes it's form in the last stanza?(what is a form?) Please help me ppl I really need help,I never used to be this bad at literature just one year gap from studies has made me a fool. .

So basically, I have hair all over my body and when I'm in the shower and i'm shaving my legs, arms, armpits, the hair never ends and when I get out of the shower I spot a place I missed and I have so much ******* hair I don't know what to do. I have it on my back, stomach, armpits (normal), arms, legs (normal), down there, ******* BUTT, sides of my face, feet (not a lot), hands, upper lip, neck, i'm ******* SICK OF IT! :'( I cry nearly every time I shower because i get so upset that I see my friends and none of them have this problem but me. I see models, actresses, they are all smooth skinned with no ******* hair and it breaks my heart because I hate it and I feel so ugly when I see it. It is literally everywhere. I've tried shaving, it just grows back stubby and has like the roots of the hairs holes when I shave it (if that makes sense?), currently I shave my arms, legs, armpits, down there. I tried waxing, it costs a lot since I got it done somewhere and if I do it myself it just hurts and takes a long time! I tried no hair cream but that smells bad and it takes a long time too, i just don't want this ******* hair on my body like the rest of the girls!!! My mom said i can get laser this october, but i literally have hair all over my body I don't know where to get it done exactly i'm scared if I ask for neck down i'll get skin cancer or something PLEASE HELP and dont ******* tell me hair is beautiful or i should ******* love myself cause that's not why i'm here! :(

TITLE:  Can I bring all my makeup and toiletries in my carry on bag?!?
BODY: So next week I'm going to the Philippines and I'm bringing a carry- on bag and carry- on luggage. 

I can't pack my makeup and toiletries in my carry- on luggage because it's all filled with my clothes, and I'm staying at there for a month. 

Since I have more space in my carry-on bag, I was wondering if you can pack all of those in there?

I watched travel videos, but they only mention about in-travel beauty items, and I want to know if you can also have not-for-travel ones.

And I only travel rarely, so I'm not really sure. Of course all my liquids are in a clear zip lock bag, which also includes my glass bottle foundation (Revlon).

Is it allowed? And if it is, would it explode or crack?

Then all my makeup, which I keep in a 'basic makeup valet'. 

It has my tweezers inside, is that okay?

Sorry for some of my silly questions I'm just a worry-bug. And thanks :)

TITLE:  Why does the ends of my hair sound crunchy?
BODY: My hair sounds really crunchy and noticed its always dry all the time. It mostly sounds crunchy from the ends when I lightly pull my hair. I have natural black hair, I bleached my hair blonde , only the top of my hair twice in a week and ever since then its made like a crunchy noise... Should I cut off the parts that are blonde? My hair from the sides and back are not bleached and it dosen't make that crunchy noise.

TITLE:  Read this excerpt from Countee Cullen's poem "The Dark Tower," and then complete the sentences that follow.?
BODY: We shall not always plant while others reap
The golden increment of bursting fruit,   
Not always countenance, abject and mute,   
That lesser men should hold their brothers cheap;
Not everlastingly while others sleep...

When Cullen speaks of planting while others reap, and standing "abject and mute," he is speaking about the  __1st fill in blank__injustices present in American society. As these injustices have changed over time, the American__2nd fill in blank______  has also shifted. Those changes are, in turn, reflected in American literature.

               1st- : racial , :internal, :casual

I have a 8 month old baby girl, i don't think he is jealous, he has not acted like this until just recently , and we spoil him like crazy. The vet said nothing is wrong with him health wise. I just do not know what all of the sudden his behavior has changed. PLEASE HELP!!

BODY: I'm a black male who exercises regularly and takes protein shakes in the daily along with a healthy diet. I only drink a beer a week as my alcohol intake, if that, and I don't smoke at all. I use extra virgin coconut oil...the organic kind sold in the health food store that cost about $12 - $17. It's edible and can be use  for hair and skin. I'm trying to grow my hair as fast a possible so I put it in my hair daily and brush my scalp for about 20 mins at a time to stimulate blood flow to my follicles and I wash it out every two days(I have short hair with waves). Will this help my hair grow faster? What other techniques and natural products should I use to make my hair grow faster???? Thanks

When I asked what the **** he was doing he said she was scratching him and he just did that so she wouldn't. I told him to never do that again and if a cat is scratching you you put them down. I was crying and yelling, and I am still so upset, and I am actually afraid of my boyfriend.

BODY: What was the point of concentration camps in WW2, if there was a genocide going on why didnt Jews simply be put down? What was the point for keeping Jews alive in concentration camps that probably used up a lot of resources and manpower for Germany? I know at the end there were more executions of Jews, but what was the unlimited goal for having them in captivity? Lastly, I know ammo was short at times, but wouldnt this be the cheapest and most humane was of killing..instead of execution by putting Jews in "ovens" or gas chambers?
I did listen to a concentration camp survivor speak live, and I also read 'Night' by Eiie Weisel, Im still a bit confused on the subject though.
Only real answers only please, Thank you Were Jews used for labor?

TITLE:  Having a difficult time selling horse?
BODY: I've had my horse for 3 years, she is my first. I worked so hard to get this horse, she has taught me a lot, and we've been through a lot together. So many great memories.

However, we are no longer a great fit together. I need something more competitive so I can progress in my riding and cannot afford to keep two horses. Sorry, I'm not rich!

I'm having a difficult time trying to do this... I've not officially put her on the market, I've only been "adverting" her through word of mouth.

 For one, I'm scared what people are going to say. Everyone I know knows how much I love this horse, always posting about her on my FB.

I'm scared that she'll end up in the wrong home so am very picky with where she goes, but I don't want that to scare people away. Basically I want vet/professional references if the person buying is not in my "network" (a friend, or a friend of a friend, or someone other horse people around me know).

And then, I'm terrified I'll regret selling her. 

Anyone have any advice, comments, words of encouragement, stories, anything? :(

TITLE:  Whistling s suddenly more noticeable?
BODY: I came back from the orthodontist after getting my braces tightened and I've noticed my "s" sounds seemed to have become more pronounced.
Idk if this is a recent development or I've already had but it's kinda annoying, will it go away? And why would tightening your braces cause this?

Ps; I can feel air coming out between my top and bottom teeth when I say sssssss a long time, is this normal?

TITLE:  I'm getting braces on my crooked teeth?
BODY: How long will it take to straighten them out? I know it's more than straightening the teeth, it's also aligning the jaw so the bite is correct. But I've noticed people have straight teeth for a long time before they get their braces off. I have crowded teeth on the bottom. Maybe attach a link to braces progress for crowded/crooked teeth over the first few weeks. I can't find one!

TITLE:  Should I continue to force feed my cat or is it a lost cause?
BODY: My cat has fatty liver disease.  We syringe feed him half the time and he eats on his own the other half.  When I say "eats on his own" I mean he will eat if someone bring him the food (he usually eats all the gravy and some morsels of food).  He sits in one spot and does not move unless it is to use the litter box or when I pick him up to give him either food or fluids (we give him 100cc a day of sub q fluids).  We have been to the vet and they said all his blood work has come back negative and that there was really no reason to bring him back because they can t find what is wrong and they know we cannot spend anymore money on vet bills.  

I should also mention he had Hyperthyroidism which has been cleared.  We believe this was the underlying issue causing his lose of appetite which led to FLD.  We want to keep him alive but it is hard to tell if we are doing the right thing/giving him enough food.  What should I do?

TITLE:  What do I say in an interview?
BODY: I am a hairstylist and have been doing hair for a couple of years now. I recently quit a job at a "real" salon, not at a chain salon. The reason I quit was because they never gave me the in salon education they said they would. It was also a nightmare of a salon to work at. 

Naturally I would not say any of these things to a potential employer. I just need something decent to say that will help me get a job, hopefully at a decent place to work. Don't tell me that this cattiness is expected with this kind of business. Not only is that not helpful, this kind of behavior seems to be in most work places. 

Anyway, a few positive words for explaining my departure would be very helpful. Thanks in advance.

BODY: I have a problem that I can t solve or find similar on the internet.

I have LG PC monitor (20 ), and Samsung LCD E550. When it s connected only the monitor, it works just fine, but when I connect HDMI, the monitor is blinking (NOT turning on/off all the time, but something like old monitors in late  80s or early  90s.). The monitor is blinking very fast all the time.

I bought 2 different quality HDMI cables (cheep &amp; expensive), but nothing changes. It remains all the same.
I tried all kind of resolutions and frequencies, but the problem can t be solved.

PC spec. - i3, 8GB, 1GB graphic card (max res. 1080p)

TV is wide, and I can t work on TV. I need to have normal screen on my monitor.


I hope you could help me, I would be really grateful.

TITLE:  Do I need ombre extensions for this hair style?
BODY: So my natural hair is just above shoulder length. I'm getting it ombre'd at the salon and I was wondering if I want to do this hair style, would I need ombre extensions or just regular blonde extensions. I don't want the dark part near the bottom of my natural hair, more towards the top and then have it blend into blonde near the bottom part of my hair. So if it's blonde at the bottom part of my hair would I just need plain blonde extensions? I'd rather do that than get ombre extensions, but I just need to know if it will blend in with my natural hair! Thanks!

BODY: ok so I have a friend that had braces back in 2011. She had them on for about 1 year, her contract was for 2 years. She took the braces off on her own with a fork (YIKES) because she couldn't keep paying her monthly payments, I know she's so dumb because she could have just left the braces on her teeth right? And well now she really regrets it of course because her teeth are getting a little crooked again and she wants to go to another orthodontics to see if she can get braces back on. Her question is, will they refuse to put braces on her teeth if she didn't finish paying off the first Ortho debt ? Help please

TITLE:  Can dry mouth cause SEVERE bad breath?
BODY: i had bad breath probs for 3 years and it worse. i even went to the dentist last month bc of it and nothing was wrong exept i had alot of plague.. i got my teeth cleaned but still, my breath still stinks. 

i thought about other probs and maybe its bc i dont drink enough water?

i drink one or less than a bottle of water everday.. its very little but i was wondering if that could be the cause. you can smell it out of my nose, and my tongue gets patchy and when i dont speak for a long time and try to speak again, my voice wont come out properly, and also i have muscus in my throat most of the time. 

im guessing its my dry mouth since my tonuge is pacthy and pieces of food (like chocolate or color of gum) will get stuck on back of toungue.

gum makes my breath smell worse and i want to find out whats causing my bad breath.

but the problem is drinking water is hard for me.. it makes me feel nauseous and bloated.. i hate the feeling of water moving around in my stomach. i only drink water while im eating.

TITLE:  Can't stop twirling my hair?
BODY: So I'm 17 years old. Even before I had a full head of hair, I was twirling it. I always had(still do) a strand of hair between my fingers. I always twirl my hair with my left hand and it doesn't matter where I twirl, but I have to twirl. I twirl without noticing or when I'm stressed. It doesn't matter if I have my hair freshly washed and done, I can't stop. I have quite long hair and I'm very proud of it. Now my problem starts here, I have a side fringe(sides bangs) and I woke up one morning and my fringe looked weird, it turned out that I must've twirled my hair so much during my sleep, I broke off a lot of my fringe. The top of my hair near my forehead is thinning from all the twirling, I really want to stop because it's becominfg a huge problem. I have everyone telling me to just stop but I CAN'T.  It is easy to say that but hard to actually do! 
A few years back I used to pull out my hair, if it looked curly or it had a split end, I still pull at split ends and constantly check for them beyond the point of obsession. I know that is probably what everyone does because split ends are hated but I really wish I wasn't so preoccupied by my hair. I also hate people touching it yet I ruin it myself by twirling. 


Somebody please help &lt;3

TITLE:  When it comes to vets, is it quality overall?
BODY: We are getting a kitten this weekend. Now, where I live there are lots of options for vets: ones that do the basics for cheap, ones that are a middle ground, and ones that will give your pet a spa treatment that would cost the average person's rent (not joking). I have found a vet that got really good reviews and the prices are very cheap ($40 for neuter, $15 for rounds of shots, $30 for check up). 

Reviews have stated that they are very good with the animals and very cheap; it seems that they want the animal healthy overall above anything else. To get what my kitten needs at other places, it's looking like $500+. This place? It'll be $160 when it's all said and done. Is that too good to be true? Should I keep looking? Experience please. I want this guy to have the best care possible.

BODY: I just got done drinking coffee but the back of my tongue has been looking weird. I barely noticed it so idk if my tongue was like this before or if I could be developing oral thrush. My tongue is not itchy or irritated or I don't have white patches anywhere in my mouth, it's just my actual tongue and the way it looks? Is there something wrong with it?

TITLE:  Horse manure mushrooms?
BODY: So I have 2 horses and we feed them regular hay and alfalfa and occasionally some oats but not really anymore. None the less I am very confused on which ones will get you high. Can you die from the ones that grow out of horse crap? They appear blue-ish black underneath the mushroom in those fan looking things. I hear it is okay to eat it if it bruises blue and black. I need answers please. 😁😁

TITLE:  How do i get my scared skittish cat to let me brush her and trim her nails at home?
BODY: I rescued our cat honey bunny about 4 years from an abusive home. when we brought her home she hid for the first 2 weeks! we had a broken closet where the door would only open 3-4 in.so we couldnt get in and she hid in there for the first week and so we had to actually take the door off the hinges to get her out and then she somehow got behind out stove! Anyway she learned pretty quick the neither my husband or myself would not hurt her and she is the most loving cat alive! she is not short haired nor long haired... kinda in the middle but def. has an undercoat. she also has a dew claw on both front paws. now right from the beginning she would freak out whenever we would try to brush her or if she even sees the claw trimmers :( we managed to trim them maybe 3 or 4 times ourselves since we got her and her dew claw was grown into her paw so bad! all kinds of gunk came out with the nail each time :( she is now getting matts as well from not letting us brush her. i dont want her in any sort of pain and i know that matts can cause pain but every time we try to brush her she growls and howls and tries desperately to get away and bc we cant trim her nails, when she get her nails in you, it HURTS! i mean is there a medicine of some sort that i can get over the counter that will maybe sedate her? tried that all natural stress relief drops but they dont work a bit. any ideas on how i can be able to get my skittishcat to let us brush her and trim her nail at home?

TITLE:  A few questions about the human eye?
BODY: So I have some questions about the human eye. 

1. Why when I close one eye, my vision isn't half black, and half, well, vision? Why does the closed eye just get cut off, unlike when both are shut?

2. Why when focusing a moving object (airplane, car, etc.) or moving in something while focusing on a nonmoving object, my eye moves swiftly with the moving or nonmoving object, while when I'm still and trying to glance from one still object to another, my eye jumps rather then glides?

3. When I look at a bright light (lightbulb, sun, etc.) after looking away there is a dark spot on my vision that eventually goes away? What is that?

Thanks to anyone who can answer these.

TITLE:  Help me live with this stupid bite plate!?!?
BODY: I just got a non-removable bite plate earlier today and so far it has been HELL. First of all I have a terrible lisp and I m too embarrassed to talk which is a problem because if I don t practice talking then the lisp won t go away, right? Also, whenever I eat, I choke, and EVERYTHING gets stuck in the plastic part as well. I try to eat soft foods, but then stuff still gets stuck in it which grosses me out and then I lose my appetite even though I m starving. I feel like I m going to lose a lot of weight and I m already a little underweight. I ve also been scraping my tongue on the plastic a lot and now it s all red. What do I do? I m so hungry and I couldn t even eat a banana. The only thing I could eat was applesauce because I just tilted it into my throat. I feel like it s not worth correcting my overbite if I starve to death before (sorry I exaggerate). By the way I m 14 and I don t have braces... yet. Anyways, advice? PLEASE :(

TITLE:  Two weeks after osseous surgery, corner of lip slightly numb, back teeth feel numb and sensitive (feeling uptight)?
BODY: Perhaps this is premature concern, but, I had osseous, (peridontal) surgery on my upper left two weeks ago. The stitches and pack came off nine days ago. I now have a slight numbness, (sometimes slight tingle) in the corners of my left lip. The two back teeth and corner of the inner jawbone have a numb feeling also. Is this normal? Will this go away in time? Is it possible the dentist may have injured a nerve? The teeth are also sensitive to cold, and even touch or tapping on the bottom tooth. I am starting to feel uptight about all this, and wondering if I would have been better off taking my chances without the surgery, (too late now) The dentist also had me sign some kind of consent form, and didn't verbally give any advance warning of risks or complications.I don't know how forthcoming he will be about the possibility that something may have happened, should I go have it looked at by another dentist?

TITLE:  I need some advice on my lazy eye?
BODY: My left eye is a lazy eye. I don t know if lazy eyes tend to have poor vision and wander or just wander, but mine does both. I used to patch it when I was younger, but when I aged to a teen my eye doctor told me that patching is just for confidence. I know that it should strengthen my eye by doing it, but it never did before, in fact my eye just keeps and always will get worse. My question is, will patching help in the long run, like if I did it once a week for a day or something along those lines? I d also like to know if there is anything I can do to help my eye (Whether it improves my vision, strengthens the muscle so my eye doesn t wander, or both).

Thanks :)

TITLE:  Will my cat ever get over the loss of her companions?
BODY: So I had three cats, two were adopted brother and sister, Nat and Sam, he other I had since I was a kid, Lacie. Sam died two weeks ago because he got hit by a car due to me being irresponsible and leaving him out when I went to work thinking "just this one time, nothing will happen." Then Lacie, we had to put her down two days ago because she was 13 and had been suffering from kidney failure for two months. We tried treating her but the vet told us we were basically prolonging the inevitable. Now, Nat is all alone. She doesn't seem upset to me. She's eating and drinking and playing like usual. I noticed her meow for no reason today but that was about it. My boyfriend suggested we get a kitten or a new cat but I'm really not ready, I'm still grieving and not used to not having my other two around and I also don't want to stress Nat out with all the changes. I'd hate for her to go from having the two cats she's always known to not having either of them and a new cat. Do you think she will eventually forget about Sam and Lacie?

TITLE:  Can paying back my dentist help my credit rating?
BODY: I had a bunch of dental work done.  I paid my co-pay and my insurance paid for a lot of the work, but not all.  As a result, I owe the dentist a little over $1000 (USD), which I'm paying off in monthly payments.  I have bad credit because of a bankruptcy 6 years ago.  So far I'm keeping my payments to the dentist up and am paying my other bills on time.  Once I've successfully paid off my dentist, will my credit improve?  Or would I be better off getting a loan from the bank (with the help of a co-signer) to pay off the dentist and then paying the bank off?

I might wanna mention that it happens once a year for 5 years now, usually around the summer, it doesn't affect my eating, I don't have bad breath, so I have absolutely no clue what's going on.

But she always talks about how she was allowed to wear eyeliner (and she said she put to much on but her mom still let her). My dad said i could get this elf clear mascara and brow gel so he can see if he'll like it and I'm goig to the store tomorrow to get it and while im there i wanted to get this mascara but my mom wont let me as i said.

TITLE:  Why does my head hurt?
BODY: Yesterday i got highlights done in my hair. This isn't the first time I've gotten highlights and  I've never had problems before but now my head is aching and I assume it's because the stylists was a little rough when washing my hair in the bowl and used somewhat hot water (hot but not unbearable) what I want to know is did my scalp get burned? The stylist that did my hair was the manager and had a certificate for top stylist and my mom recommended her to me because she has been doing hair for 10+ years so I don't think my scalp burned. The highlights I got were a light brown and she didn't need to use much bleach because I originally had some color in it. My hair is VERY thick and curly and I always wear it natural so I don't think it's damaged. I'll admit my hair is dry so that may also be the problem. 
Sorry for the long essay but I wanted to give as much information as possible. 
Does my head hurt because of the way she washed it or did my scalp burn? (I feel like I have a normal headache but my head does feel a little itchy but nothing unbearable please help thank you!)

TITLE:  How can I grow my hair super long?
BODY: I have hair a couple inches above my belly button, I just got a much needed 3 inch trim after 6 months. I would love hair a little below my belly button. I use no sulfate shampoo and a coconut strength serum almost every day which prevents breakage and seals in nutrients (its kind of an oil). I also do a deep conditioning with coconut oil once every two weeks. I really want it long but also healthy, but trimming it a lot just makes it stay the same length. Any other tips on how to get it long and healthy? Thanks!

She got out a dime sized amount, put it in her hair, got 5 more blobs, 10 more blobs, and just kept putting more and more and more. (I'm not sure how many blobs, but it seemed like about 20 more or less. (She's still conditioning it lmao) I was like "why are you wasting so much??" And she's like "I always use this amount. It doesn't feel right yet,"

Is that too much or is that fine??

BODY: Yesterday doctor had prescribed him with eyeglasses and an eye patch because his right eye is weaker than his left one .
doctor told that his eye sight will get improve with the age but I really wonder about his statment 
because  I've start wearing glasses when I was 5 years old and my eyes never got better instead it got worse .Now Im 16 years and my eye sight is kind of bad .
(My right eye is -6.75 and left is - 7.00) 

and the other factor is all the members of our family are wearing glasses .Both of my parents and my elder brother and my younger sister .

TITLE:  My hair won't grow???!?
BODY: 8th grade year I cut my hair to my chin. It took until 9th grade to get right above my breasts. 10th grade year it made it just barely below my breasts. And 11th grade year I decided to get a perm (which damaged my hair beyond belief!) after that, it STOPED growing completley! I started putting olive oil, coconut oil, argon oil, etc in my hair every night. I tried egg hair treatments, and deep conditioner, you name it, I've done it. I've even tried massaging my scalp and flipping my hair over allowing the blood to flow to my scalp. 12th grade year I decided to cut off my dead ends. Now I am graduated and since then, its only grew 1 inch. I seriously want my hair almost to my waiste but nothing works! Please give me tips! I've been struggling with this for 4 years!

I finally got it out after a few minutes and cleaned it then I put it back in and it didn't burn but my eye keep watering and I could feel the contact in my eye. I took the contact out again but now my eye burns without the contact in. The only way it doesn't burn is when I close it.

TITLE:  Cat s urine is orange, but all tests are clear &amp; vet doesn t know why?
BODY: There is NO blood in his urine, as well, there are no crystals. His vet said his complete blood work results were perfect. His vet cleared him of tick fever and bobcat fever (no yellowing of eyes, gums, etc.) and pancreatitis (pain is closer to where the kidneys are and there was no vomiting).  He s able to void his bladder on his own.  

His vet initially kept him overnight only because he had a very high fever and was dehydrated. Overnight was when they found out that he had the orange urine. His fever broke by this morning though and he was better hydrated by then, so his vet let me take him home. He s on Clavamox (antibiotic) and a pain reliever. 

His vet said he wasn t sure what the problem was exactly, because nothing was showing up on the tests. The only clues were the high fever, orange urine, dehydration, and slight pain near the kidneys. His vet said he d continue to research this while I treat him at home with the meds. 

If it were his kidneys, it should have showed up on the tests, right? Does anyone have any idea what could be wrong? Thank you.

Does anyone know where to get one?

I know I've asked this before but nobody answered, so I figured I would ask again.

One side is fairly thick and can easily cover them, however, it makes it easy to tell that I'm wearing them due to the thickness. The other side is extremely thin and short and it is very difficult to hide and place them. Finally, I can never get the back of the head to look right it usually looks very obvious that I'm wearing hair extensions. So I have to wear my hair in the front. Any advice?

TITLE:  How should I cut my hair? (I really need help)?
BODY: I've had the same hair cut for almost 6 years. I often get told that it is one of my best features, therefore I never done anything to it. But now, it's time for a change.  I can't decide on what I want to do with it though. So, I need some suggestions.
 My hair is past the middle of my back, has layers because it's so thick, is a light brown, and is fried and ready for a change. My face is round, with blue eyes, and a small forehead. 
I've thought about a blunt lob, a pixie (like the Miley Cyrus one), an undercut and leaving my hair the length it is, a bowl cut (mushroom), an undercut bob, or a buzz cut. I know that list is long, and has very different/ dramatic hairstyles but I need a change, like bad. My boyfriend and I have talked about this, and he said he's cool with whatever I do, I just need some help choosing! 

Thanks in advance!

TITLE:  Eyesight genetic or environmentally influenced?
BODY: I've heard both arguments and I'm curious as my situation doesn't exactly fit either. Both my parents have pretty good eyesight. They use reading glasses sometimes now while their in their late 40s. I have an older sister and both of us have terrible vision. Ironically, ours both just suddenly got worse in 8th grade. We've followed the same pattern nearly identically (her prescription will go up .75 when she's 16 and when I turn 16 I'll get near or same prescription). So it seems that our vision failings are nearly identical. She's 22 and her vision has finally stopped getting worse after several years. We showed no disposition to bad vision earlier. No glasses, no struggles, but suddenly in 8th I realized that I couldn't see the board and I actually thought it was normally and didn't say anything until I casually mentioned that I wish everyone could see the individual leaves on trees.

We have a younger brother thats 12 years younger than her and 9 years younger than me. Is it likely he'll get bad vision in 8th grade too? Or was mine and my sisters just a really bizarre coincidence?

TITLE:  How do I teach my cats to use separate litter boxes/food and water bowls?
BODY: I've had one male cat for a year and recently adopted a female cat from the animal shelter about two weeks ago. I took her to the vet a few days after I adopted her and found out she has feline herpes virus, which is contagious to other cats. I'm pretty upset about this; especially since I asked the shelter specifically if she had any health problems I should know about, and they told me she did not. I do not want the new cat to give my "old" cat the herpes virus. They share food/water and litter boxes. I never intended for them to do this. On the day I adopted new kitty, I went out and bought all new items just for her: food/water bowl and litter box w/ pine litter (it's what they used at the shelter). I figured using two different kinds of litters might help. For a while, new kitty was using her box with the pine, but since a few days ago has stopped and been going in the other cat's box. He doesn't really care or mind. But like I said, new kitty has feline herpes and I don't want her to spread it. They also share their food/water bowls despite the fact that I have two of each. What can I do to get them to stop sharing?

TITLE:  Am I only the who find Hitler to be inspirational?
BODY: Okay this question may sound bad to start with but let me explain. First of all I obviously don't agree with some of his actions, but you have to admit he was a powerful, persuasive well-spoken leader.
He transformed Germany from a bankrupt country into one of the biggest powerhouses in the world. He convinced a whole country that killing an entire race of people was the right thing to do (I don't agree with his opinion I just find it admirable his speeches were powerful enough for people to believe him.)
Although I can't agree with Hitler's actions, I can respect him for his incredible speeches and also being such a passionate man who genuinely wanted the best for his country. Does anyone else agree with this or am I the only one sick enough to find inspiration in Hitler?

They tell me if you have long hair you should do something with it. I usually just leave my hair as is. The only thing I do with it is put it up in a ponytail sometimes.

My hair gets frizzy on the top of my head. That's why I usually give up on my hair and wear it as is. What types of styles can I do with my hair?

TITLE:  Dental Office Closed/Severe Pain?
BODY: Hello, I currently had an appliance (I believe that's what it is called) inserted in my mouth by my orthodontist in order to push forward a tooth, however, on June 30th, I felt it (the appliance) pushing against my gum. I called the office and found out from a recording that they are closed from June 29 until July 5 for independence holiday. There is no one there on call, and even when they do re-open, the orthodontist is only there on Wednesdays and Thursdays so I would have to wait another 2-3 days after they open to be seen. the pain is EXCRUCIATING and has dug further into my gums, causing some bleeding occasionally. I've tried even pulling it back myself as to bend it away from my gum but it's no use. What can I do? I've tried NSAIDs, and they haven't helped. Can I visit another dentist office in the mean time?

TITLE:  16 and my hair keeps falling out?
BODY: My hair started falling out around May.  I know it's normal to loose hair, but whenever I brush mine or gently tug on the ends, I always get hair coming out without any pain.  I used to shower everyday and use heat on it but I stopped.  I now shower every 2-3 days and I haven't used heat since May.  My scalp is itchy a lot on the bottom though.    My hair now kind of feels dry and oily. I'm trying not to get myself stressed about it but it's hard.  I can't think of any reasons as to why I'd be stressed.  I'm on summer vacation and having a good time.  My hair used to be so thick.  I also don't really eat that healthy or exercise as much as I should.  I'm getting a blood test in August so maybe I can ask about it?

TITLE:  Should the Atlanta Hawks go after 2015 NBA free agents Greg Monroe/Robin Lopez at C, Amare Stoudimire at PF , and Nate Robinson PF?
BODY: The Atlanta Hawks lost key players SF DeMarre Carroll via free agency to the Toronto Raptors and F/C Pero Antic to play overseas. 

NBA free agents F/C Greg Monroe, PF Amare Stoudimire, and PG Nate Robinson are still available. The N.Y. Knicks, L.A.Lakers, and Portland Trail Blazers all have shown Interest in Greg Monroe as well si if Monroe signs w/ either other team C Robin Lopez would be a good a consolation prize.

I'm sure the Hawks would prefer having Nate Robinson over PG Shelvin Mack and Amare Stoudimire over PF Mike Scott.

That would mean trading G/F Thabo Selfolsha, PF Mike Scott, SF Kent Bazemore, and PG Shelvin Mack for a SF.

This would be the roster:
CENTER: Greg Monroe or Robin Lopez, Tiago Splitter, and Mike Muscala; 

POWER FORWARD: Al Horford, Amare Stoudimire, Dimitrious Agravains;

SMALL FORWARD: Paul Millsap, Austin Daye, and another SF via NBA trades;

SHOOTING GUARD: Kyle Krover, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Marcus Eriksson;

POINT GUARD: Jeff Teague, Nate Robinson, and Dennis Schroder.

Would this line be an NBA threat in the NBA East?

TITLE:  Second Gpu/Graphic card Setup for dedicated PhysX.?
BODY: I have just purchased a mid range Gpu a Nivida Gforce Gtx 750 ti. Which i have since over clocked Now the real question is my old card was a Nivida Gforce gt 640 which i was contemplating using as a dedicated PhysX secondary card. So the question is would it be worth it or should i just run the one card. If it helps i also have two monitors hooked up and was thinking hooking the second monitor to the second card for movies and such while i play games. maybe. i don't think it would make a difference but really want some advice if the gt640 running PhysX would be any advantage at all. Thanks for any reply.

(at the park when I play with friends and so on, I get called the green giant. ) bc I wear a bright green hoodie. So here are some I already have but they suck. Green Giant and pterodactyl.  I like pterodactyl bc it actually describes my shoulder blades. They stick out of my back at an awkward angle and look like wings. And I can jump. So I kinda like it.  But eh. Help here? I call myself icy hot bc I am kind of a streaky shooter. That's why I am a 4 man

But she was hungry again, hyper and using the litterbox. My mom thinks she ate something that didnt settle well with her but she's all normal now, she ate her breakfast and lunch with no fuss. She's being as talkative as usual and running around while we clean the house. What do you think? Has this happened to anyone before? I rang the vet and they said she might have eaten something and gotten it out of her system by throwing up

TITLE:  I had a weird blister/bump on my lower inner gum, right near my tongue bed?
BODY: It was angled in a way I couldn't see it, but I think it popped accidentally? It doesn't hurt at all, and I feel no discomfort. It was just weirdly there, and now it's like just what's left of it? When I press my tongue against it, it doesn't hurt. But like I said it's angled in a way so that even sticking a compact in my mouth and looking another mirror, I can't see it. &gt;_&lt;

TITLE:  My 9 month old cats eye turned yellow?
BODY: I have an adorable 9 month old kitty ( Siamese &amp; tabby mix), she has the brightest blue eyes, but coming home from vacation, I noticed that one of her eyes turned yellow! Not the white, the entire iris( colored part of the eye) and has a bit of pinkish/red around it ( in the whites of the eyes). She's acting completely normal and everything else is fine and I've been told that her eyes been yellowish for a couple of days. Has anyone dealt with anything like this before?!

Can I just color over it or do I have to wash out the color to get back to the base bleach layer? I don't want to bleach my hair again since I already bleached it, so I was wondering if I could just color over since I'm going darker.

http://www.kevinfreitas.net/blog/diy-cat-food-box/
and it s exactly what I m looking for. Unfortunately, they didn t talk at all about HOW they cut the hole in their sterilite bin. So, any ideas? Recommendations? Something easy to use, preferably. I m a nineteen-year-old girl with no power tools to speak of. XD

TITLE:  Can you improve on this poem [Message in a Bottle] in Blank Verse, a Templar Knight installment?
BODY: Proem

After Sir Thomas recovered the Spear of Destiny and returned it to the Pope at the Vatican in Rome, he remained there for several months serving His Excellency, attending meetings, and recovering from several minor injuries sustained while recapturing the Spear the pierced the side of Jesus the Messiah.  Sir Thomas could have stayed as a guest of the pope in one of their lush suites, but he chose the bare walls of a guest bedroom at the local Knights Templar castle.   The pope then called upon him for his next assignment:  “Leave Rome immediately, by boat, again, back to Constantinople.  Head off a Scot by the name of Sir Robert Bruce, whom our Intel indicates has a map and is currently on his way in search for the Holy Grail.  Sir Robert is a stubborn ally.  You will help Sir Robert, but convince him that the chalice of Jesus belongs here in Rome, if indeed, you do find it.”

Prior to shoving off the west coast of Italy, a few miles from Rome, Sir Thomas wrote the following message on a section of parchment, and placed it in a bottle.

Message in a Bottle

A.D. 1301

My dear sweet wife and babe within her womb
The five long years since I had lost you both
I prayed for inner peace despite my joy
You're both in heaven;  worship Thee Most High

Because your love exceeds all life itself
My lips will glorify you ever more
I praise you for the rest; my living days
Your name I lift on high with my bare hands

Was on my bed that I remember you
I think of you the watches of the night
The shadow of your wings I cling my soul
The depths of which my sword shall honor thee

I yearn affections taste where two come one
The seed by faith that yields abundant life
Endures celestial kingdom's perfect place
It brings this missive to its endless oath:

To bless, release my restless heart that bleeds
Commit my swords allegiance to the Lord
To you Dagung the earth is smaller still
For every inch be searched to see your face

You disappeared, not dead but still alive
I feel the transom temper my resolve
For in this ship another search begins
The Holy Grail; Dagung I'll find you both
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Postscript

I toss the bottle through the wind to stormy sea
Inside the missive of a knight in love with thee

TITLE:  Do I need to see the doctor?
BODY: Okay same I am at this camp and 2 days ago I hit my head on this bar/pole like thing on the playground. I turned my head around and hit it and I was dazed for only like 2 seconds. I got a minor headache but I didn't lose consiousness or anything. I had to sit down for a little. Then yesterday during class I had random bursts of a kinda sharp headache on the right side every 15 seconds but then it just ended after like 5 min. Today all I have is that very minor headache (ex if im doing something I won't notice it at all and sometimes I don't even feel it/it goes away) and it feels like a minir miragine. I don't have any other symptoms like vomiting or confusion or memory loss. However right now I still have that headache when I wake up. I can't see a doctor here but when I go home (in 2 weeks) should I see a doctor? If the headache goes away should I see the doctor? If the headache is still there should I? If new symptoms show should I go? Is there any possible way I would have a mild brain injury? Is having a headache like 3 days after normal? If its minor do I stoll need to go?

The thing is, my natural hair is dark brown with reddish undertones, when I did the ombré it produced this nice auburn color. 

If I dye my hair dark brown and the bleach it, will it still produce that auburn color?

TITLE:  How in the world do I prevent this from happening again!!!!!?
BODY: I wake up this morning because of a rattling noise. It happens... Stops, happens again then stops. I debate what it could be as I get out of bed and WAKE UP. Half asleep I get my flashlight and check to make sure no one jumped into the filter box. Nope. That's fine. I look in the tank and one of my two fish is missing!!!! I wait for the noise, I hear it again. I think "OHH ****!!!" Because its coming from BEHIND the old TV stand my fish tank is on. I quickly move my stand and see nothing. I move the two papers that found their way down there and BOOM. I find a dust bunny fish. At first glance it looked dead, after all who could survive that long out of water? I pick it up... It moves! Acting fast I move him back into the fish tank, removing the dust. Now he seems fine, a bit stressed as imagined but he is fine. 

I don't have much of a gap between my filter and lid. It's the small gap above that the fish used and jumped out of the tank onto the stand and flopped down into the crevice in between the wall. How can I prevent this in the future without my tank looking like some prison.... (Fish tanks are... But like more of a prison....)


Do you think this will happen again? Do you think the fish learned his lesson and won't do it again? This scared me so bad! It woke me up and I'm a heavy sleeper.

TITLE:  Is it ok to start feeding my 9/mo old cat adult cat food?
BODY: I called my vet and she said it was ok to start doing it now .... But she said to start off by measuring 3/4 cup of the kitten food mixed with 1/2 cup of the adult food &amp; keep feeding the car like that for over a week and then she said once I done that for a little, then start giving him just plain ADULT CAT FOOD . 

My question is , right now I feed my cat 1/2 cup of day of kitten food .... So 1/4 cup in the morning and 1/4 cup later on in the day equalling to 1/2 cup .  He's fine in weight and he's not over weight . I don't like him eating too much where he would be obese . So I cut his food in half so he doesn't eat it all at once .

How can I split 3/4 in half where he's not eating it all at once .....????? I know half of 3/4 is 3/8 but I never been good at math and I'm trying to measure the food in a cooking measuring cup with fluid oz ... PLEASE HELP!

TITLE:  Ankle sprain and broken ankle?
BODY: I broke my fibula and partially tore two ligaments in my right ankle last November. I was in a walking boot and crutches for the first two months and walking boot for another month. I got physical therapy when I got out of the boot. After about a month into my non weight bearing period, I, for some reason, thought it'd be okay to try to walk without my boot and when I took a step, my ankle rolled under me. I was literally screaming in pain. That injury made it take longer for my ankle to heal. April this year, I got a minor sprain on that same ankle, then, in May, I got a bad sprain on my left ankle. I knew it wasn't broken both times so I didn't do anything for them. Now, both of my ankles are very weak and I cannot wear high heels because I am sure I'll break my ankle again if I do. It's really hard to stand on one foot. The biggest problem is that my right ankle is still pretty swollen and hurts 24/7. Sometimes the pain is minor enough that I can ignore it but sometimes, it hurts a lot. It's not like it hurts to walk; the amount it hurts when I'm resting is the same as when I'm walking or running. It's the same for my left ankle, but it's not as bad. That's fine because it's not been long since I've sprained it. I try not to run or else I'll end up twisting my ankle. So, basically both my ankles are swollen, but the right one's worse(the bump that sticks out on my ankle is always hidden by the swelling) and hurts more than the left(bump is hidden or barely visible). So, here's the question: what's wrong with my ankles? Will they heal as time passes or do I have to go to a doctor? Thanks so much for reading my long story.

TITLE:  Hamster bites cage bars when she smells food?
BODY: I was picking out unhealthy snacks in her food seed mix (She's a pudding hamster, I heard that some foods make her sick) and she started biting on her cage bars, climbing up and just looking really frantic to get out. Sometimes she squeezes behind her wheel and climbs into the bars, and just clings there to bite the bars. She's done it so much in the last few days I got her that there's a black spot above her nose (I read that it's because of her rubbing against the cage bars while trying to bite them). What should I do? should I get her a new cage? is she just bored?

I know my hair will be damaged and I'm done dying/bleaching my hair for awhile so I'm not going to a salon. Well I already have boy short hair. If I get a trim (cut off the dead ends) and deep condition it and do hair treatments will it be okay? I know I'm stupid for doing this :/

BODY: Hello people, so in the upcoming few days I'll be finally ordering my parts, I am very excited since thsi will be my first build, and I'm pretty confident about that. So to the question, I dont understand one thing. Does my hardrive include both C: and D:, or is C: with all the system files in it (as usual, right?) located in the motherboard? If so, when I'll finish building, and I will have my old (current) hardrive inside my new PC, what  Windows will I have? Or will it be completly the same like on here, by that I mean the hardrive contains both C: and D:?

Thanks!

I took her to the vet and hey said her bladder is empty, that she doesnt even have any pee or blockage and the vomiting/diarrhea is due to eating an insect or something. Has this ever happened to anyone? Its been an hour since we got back and I've been trying to get her to drink water but she's refusing, she's taking a nap after the stress of the car ride. Please please please answer, has this ever happened to anyone? Why isn't she drinking water? (The vet literally says she has no pee in her and thats why she's straining) and if she has no pee why is she straining??

TITLE:  Remove vegetable based dye from bleached hair safely at home? Hairdresser answers please!?
BODY: I went to the salon about a month ago and the colorist put in bleached hilights and then did the whole head with a vegetable based dye. Now most of it is out except for the purple over the bleached parts. I need it out NOW for an event. I have already tried dish soap, baking soda, and clarifying shampoo, with disappointing results. I have heard that laundry detergent or alcohol may work but i don't want to fry off my hair (please comment if you've done one of those. Please don't comment if you think it sounds stupid but have no experience with it.) I'd really appreciate an answer from a hairstylist or from someone who has successfully tried at home hair dye removal. Don't tell me to buy product or get it professionally fixed, that's not an option at this point. Thanks!

BODY: I just want normal straight hair, which it mostly is..  But several hairs on top of my head are wavy and looks bad...  Do I have to use a flat iron or something and some argan oil to keep it from being so dry? That's about all i can think of...  What do you suggest.

TITLE:  So how cat I get my cat to loose weight?
BODY: My cat is 8 years old, and weighs 20 some pounds. He's huge. But he has always been large. He is a big cat, weight aside. He is the biggest cat I've ever seen. For instance he begs at the dinner table (learned from the dogs) and he can stand up on his hind feet and reach up and look at what's on the table. He's tall. He reminds me of a tiger. I love him to death. I'd gladly take a bullet for my two cats, and I wouldn't complain a bit, pain and all, the only thing would be a single teach rolling down my face as I stood bleeding out. He and my other cat (she isn't fat) are by babies! I've had them since I was seven. (Do the math, I'm 15) I've tried everything I can think of. I'm working on the treadmill... Hopefully I can do it, I've seen others who've gotten their cats to do it. I've tried toys, separating the food into two portions and feeding the cats separate I've attempted to leash train him. All failed. He eats both portions of cat food, then begs my other family members for more, as if he wasn't fed.  If we don't feed him more, he will continue to cry, if we ignore him, he eats dog food. Yes, DOG FOOD. He's so rotten XD. All he ever does is eat and sleep. When I separated the food I fed him in my room and the other in the laundry room, he did fine but my mom got tired of cat food in my room. Said it was weird, so what? Idc.  I want what's best for him but how can I give him that if its so HARD!!!!

BODY: I got a green spotted puffer fish a few days ago and I have yet to see him eat! He is a baby so he is in a 10 gallon fresh water tank with a heater, filter, and plenty of leaves to rest on and a cave to hide in. He is swimming around and enjoying himself and he even has the little reflective spot on his head (which I read means he s real happy). I ve tried freeze dried blood worms, flake food, real worms, thawed frozen brine shrimp, but I haven t seen him eat any of it! I ordered some snails so they should be in in about a week, but idk what to do until then! Please help!

TITLE:  65 Gallon Tank Stocking?
BODY: Hello! I had a 20g tank with 
3 Swordtails
1 Siamese Algae Eater 
5 Galaxy Rasboras 
6 Neon Tetras
3 Dwarf Rasboras
3 Guppies
4 Bumblebee gobies 
2 Pictus Catfish 

(I know this was over stocked but we were getting the tank in a few days and it was a good deal.) 

So I got the 65g and took the process of putting fish in a new (cycled etc) and everyone is doing great. They have so much room! 

I was wondering if you guys have any recommendations for some cool fish or centre piece fish? I had my eye on electric blue Rams. But I haven't done research yet. Thanks :)

I have a 20 gallon tank that I've had up and the filter/air pump running now for about a week. I was wondering how many GloFish tetras I could have in my tank. Along with tank mates for them so I can have a good variety. I figured I'd ask here since the Walmart people don't usually have any idea.

Sometimes he will shakely swim backwards!

No one has seen her anywhere but me at night only twice and she wouldn't even come close to me ran off another direction towards a neighborhood we dont live in. I ended up bringing a friend to go there and talk to the people who live there they said they have a cat just like mine with a birth mark on her lip blue eyes, and gray and white (what are the odds of that!) so basically we all think they kidnapped her but we are not 100 percent sure though. What should I do?

My wife noticed that I am kind of good with hair stuff in general,and she pushes me to become a hairstylist,I never ever thought of that (at least for a man) .Bottom line is I don't like the idea,but on the other hand we had already some rather rough talk,and she really want me in that hair school....I am upset....I fear I will look ridiculous for some reason working in a ladie's salon....

TITLE:  Should I contact this tattoo artist?
BODY: I found an image on Tumblr of a sketch that I fell in love with and immediately wanted inked on my body. Unfortunately the source on Tumblr was not the artist and the poster never responded back to my question (I asked if they knew who it was). After some searching I came across an etsy store with the image and contacted them and they gave me the link to the artist. Turns out he's a tattoo artist who lives in England and I'm in America. I really want to contact him to let him know I love his image and want it tattooed but obviously the distance is to far away for me to travel to him.
Is this right of me to ask? Or should I just not get the tattoo. I really love the image and I admire it so much yet I don't want to insult him by asking if I can get his sketch done by someone else. I would even be willing to pay him for letting me use his image, I feel as if that's fair.

Is it okay to email the person and ask them if their horse(which ever horse i'm looking at to breed to my mare) is up for cross breeding?Obviously I wont even breed my mare until next year, it's too late in the year now to breed but is it okay to ask or should I not?I'm literally concerned though so I feel like I need to ask, I just don't know if it's the right time.

TITLE:  What is considered "Long Hair"?
BODY: About 4ish or longer months ago, I asked for a small trim, and the hair dresser chopped 6 inches of my hair off, causing it to obviously become a lot shorter. I felt like my hair was medium length then, and now it is 3ish inches away from being its previous length, but I still feel like it is shorter or medium, but not in a good way. It s like the 12 year old phase, but for hair, where everything is really awkward. I ve been growing my hair out for two or three years, that last cut being the most drastic thing that I ve done to it. So, I m basically asking what long hair is considered to be? Is mine still medium length (mid breast)? If so, how long will it be to be considered long? Thanks :)

BODY: I have about mid-breast length hair, and I was thinking about getting ombre similar to the picture below, but I don't know if it will look good with my length and color. I have extremely fine hair  with a lot of layers and a slight V, it isn't dark or light brown hair but in-between with a super subtle bronze look. It is about medium thickness, and if this matters at all I have a round face with fuller cheeks. Should I get it? Thanks! 

If so, is there anything I should be aware of or ask for specifically?

TITLE:  How often would it be safe to run her here?
BODY: I have a mare who I am training for Barrel Racing. She is perfect for it because she is a speed demon, loves to stretch her legs and when we do run the course, you can just feel each individual foot dig into the ground with pure pleasure. Lol, not sure if she likes it because I do, or if she doesn't care what I think and loves it anyway. 

But currently we are having to retrain because this is my first time horse, so of course I have a few things to fix in the Barrel Training. She is cooperating well in the slow paced, boring training, although she gets really bored really quickly. I swear, she will start yawning and starts trying to go faster. I hate it too, but I don't show it because I know the training will help in the long run.

Anyway, at least once a week I take her on a trail ride to the dirt road. It is a exact mile dirt road and I canter her to the halfway point because there are a lot of dogs that spook her. At the halfway point, she KNOWS she is able to run and it takes all my might to keep her back when I don't want to run her. Once I set myself up and take off the pressure she takes off and runs to the end.

I was wondering how often it would be safe to run her down this dirt road? She positively loves it and it is hard to keep her held back. Its definitely not the best place to run her but it is the only place. All the fields are grown up with corn and the closest racetrack for horses is 3 hours away, and it is the only dirt road.

TITLE:  My cat is having trouble walking?!?! I need answes quickly!!?
BODY: Yesterday cat jumped down from the arm of my arm chair, and it seemed like she landed funny. She limped around for the rest of night, I figured she'd be okay so I went to sleep.
But today, she won't walk. Every time she tries, she just falls over. Her left, front leg is on we are having trouble with. It seems like it's limp? 
We don't have a way to get her to the vet, she doesn't like cars. The experience of being in a car could be very traumatizing for her, AND she doesn't like people she doesn't know. Bringing her to the vet is out of question, right now.
She did eat food, but I had to feed her myself.
I looked it up, and I saw there were some mental things that could possibly do this? But I also saw that it could be a sprain, and I hope thats what it is.
Please, answer!!

It is not about water quality I change the water every 5 days and I tested the water ammonia levels are well below .25 and that is on the 4th day. I do not have a filter. Could it be the declorinizer I use? I use api stress coat

But I read that a healthy leopard gecko should have a big tail but mine doesn't. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Should I feed her more? (She also has a heat pad and a heat lamp,)

TITLE:  Budgie in the nest box..?
BODY: I have a male and a female budgie and a nest box set up. I've been hoping to breed them for a while as they are a bonded adult pair. My female took no interest in the nest box until about 5 days ago when the female went in and remodeled the nesting material the way she liked it. Now, she's been in the nest box without leaving it for anything but food and water in the past 2 days. I'm not sure if this means they are breeding because I haven't seen the female courting the male or any breeding activity besides her liking for the nest box. Is this normal for her to be spending this much time in there without (I'm assuming) mating?? Is she ignoring the male and laying infertile eggs? Or have they just been mating without me seeing? If this is the case, how long until she lays eggs. Thanks in advanced, I'm super excited!!

BODY: Ok. During the day I don't produce any saliva at all. I have to constantly drink or chew gum. When I wake up every morning my pillow is always so wet of saliva, that I have to flip the pillow to the fresh side. It doesn't make sense, I mean during the day I need the saliva not while  I'm sleeping! I don't have diabetes I already got tested. Any of you have experienced or know how to fix this?

TITLE:  My cat has swelling and hair loss on her face?
BODY: Okay so I just noticed that my cat has swollen bump on the side of her face on her cheek, and a quarter sized patch of fur is completely gone on part of the bump. I vaguely remember noticing that half her face was a little bit larger than the other in maybe the last day or two, but I only noticed the bald spot just now. I have pressed on the bump and it doesn't seem to hurt her and she seems completely healthy besides that. Also, she has a dark spot of skin in her bald patch. It looks like a patch of dark skin, I know cats sometimes have multicoloured skin, but if I look close enough it almost looks like there is a seam around it, like it isn't entirely connected to the rest of her skin we are taking her to the vet as soon as possible, but if anyone has any idea what it could be that would be great. We are very worried.

TITLE:  Rate my poem from a scale of 1 to 10?
BODY: Title: Feels Like Love

There s something about this boy
I fell in love with
Maybe he s my prince
With a different outfit

There s something about his words
That makes me fly away
I couldn t find anything more to say
I wished for nothing
But him to stay

There s something about his eyes
That makes my eyes glaze
It feels as if I have stepped
Into a tough maze

There s something about my heart
That gives a loud beat
As I find him looking at me
Smiling with a greet

There s something about his laugh
That I just can t get enough
I know it seems like a mindless dream
But it feels like love

P.S I m thirteen.

TITLE:  Why are people hyping up Lamarcus Aldridge? Why do the Lakers want him? Are they stupid?
BODY: Lakers fans have to be the dumbest fans ever.

Aldridge ain't that good. He isn't a franchise player, sorry. He's a very good player, but he isn't a TRUE superstar. He was nowhere to be found in this year's playoffs. Disappearing act. Same with Lillard. Blazers underachieved big time. I thought last year was a sign of things to come, a promising sign, but I was wrong.

I just don't see Aldridge as the Tim Duncan type or even a superstar type. Not talking a legendary player, but he's not even a superstar.

I don't trust Aldridge. I can't trust that Aldridge will come out one night and completely take over the game and destroy the opposing team's morale. He ain't that good.

He's also 30 years old.

BODY: Long story short my aunt pet cockatiel bird has died so she decided to bury it in her backyard in a dirt pile next to her window that is by her master bedroom. Her window is not far down from outside. Meaning if a burglar wanted to break in from outside her bedroom window he does not have to step on anything to get in her room. But the question that I have is do dead birds carry diseases over time and it comes up through the air with the rain or something? I'm now kind of afraid to go over there because I don't want to get sick because she bury the dead bird next to her window outside  in her room which is also close by the living room. I also have two dogs that she watches for me when I go out of town sometimes and they do urinate in that area where the dead bird is buried will they get sick

TITLE:  How can i finally close my diastema (gap between my two front teeth)?
BODY: in high school i wore braces for a year and a half SOLELY to close the gap between my two front teeth. within the 24 hours after my braces were taken off and i was waiting for a retainer to be made, the gap opened back up again. once i got the retainer, i had to wear it overnight and then my gap would stay closed without it during the day but would open up back up by the end of the day. about a year later my retainer broke and within the 2 days i had to wait to get a new mold for a new retainer, my gap had completely opened up and the clear retainer that was made only kept them together WHILE i was wearing it and only then. it's been years since then and i have had to wear a clear retainer ever since 24/7 because my gap opens up as soon as i take it off. immediately! 
i'm schedule to have a frenectomy done (to remove the tissue between my 2 front teeth) but a lot of people are saying that that won't actually close it and that i will need braces again. 
what is the final solution?! 
my dentist says that bonding isn't an option because it will make my front teeth too large and even permanently bonded retainers behind the front teeth can break off eventually. and, not only are veneers extremely expensive, but they also would make my teeth too large.
is there a final solution to get rid of this gap permanently?! or is this just something i'm going to have to live with?

TITLE:  Tips on Hurdles?
BODY: Hey, so I m doing hurdles tomorrow on Sports Day. This is my only event, any tips? I m actually quite, quick for my age (only attempted at two races, however) but I have never been taught.

A girl who has been taught before properly (she went to a private school) only got 0.1sec quicker than me, and got best in district,  and the teacher s only timed with a stopwatch, I really would like it if I could beat her. 

Any tips to quickly improve for a beginner? Thanks guys ((:

BTW I think this is a 80m? Or 85m hurdle event?

TITLE:  Tap Dancing for beginners?
BODY: Hiya! So I'm a 16 year old girl that tall and thick (curvy, not sure it this makes a difference or not)  and I would like to do tap dancing! But I have no idea where to begin!
Once upon a LONG time ago, I used to tumble and dance, but I was 5 or 6 so I remember nothing.
Where do I begin? As you can see, I don't even know what questions to ask.
Can you just kind of give me an overview of tap and what I should do and get sense I'm a beginner? There's a studio around my house that I'm thinking about, and I have to registered soon because classes start August 4th! 
Thanks so much in advanced! 

P.S I'm assuming tap is really good exercise.

TITLE:  How to bleach thick, dark hair?
BODY: I m going over to a friends house this weekend and she wants me to dye her hair, however I ve never dyed or bleached hair like hers before. It looks a lot like this; http://www.hairswallpaper.com/rihanna-mohawk-haircut/rihanna-mohawk-haircut-yumx/ although she has an undercut (where it s shaved all the way around w/ long hair on the top). She wants me to bleach it and then dye it blue, 

What products do you recommend for bleaching? How many times should I bleach it? And for how long? 

As for the dye, she wants me to use  Splat, though I feel that she might need something stronger, suggestions?

Also, her hair is virgin hair, so I might need to do an extra bleach or so. Thank you!!

TITLE:  Can Rafael Nadal bounce back from his poor form?
BODY: After another early exit at wimbledon, I'm starting to lose faith in rafa. He's struggled before and has had periods of poor form but he's always managed to overcome it, but I don't think he can come back from this, not at his age. At 29, after about a decade of playing with the most physically grueling style of play,  he probably has more wear and tear than tommy hass who's 37. I figured he'd bounce back after a subpar 2014 season, but things have just gotten worse. I'd like to believe he can refind his form again, but realistically I think he's done. What do you guys think? Can nadal find his form and play top level tennis again? Or has he peaked and will just play even poorer from here on out?

BODY: I am 13 and want to start wearing makeup. I have acne problems that I really wanna cover up. I do wash my fave and have a good routine of doing it. I would like to wear:
Bb cream
Concealer
Pressed powder
Mascara(I know this doesn't cover acne up I just wanna wear it :) )

Do you think this is too much? What did you wear at my age? I am nervous to ask my mom. She has asked me if girls in my grade wear makeup but I kinda blew off the question? Any tips of advice?
Thanks :)

BODY: I have had my guinea pigs for 10 days now and since day one they have been sneezing. I assumed it was an allergy to my fleece bedding so I didn't do anything about it other then buy new detergent. More recently I noticed one of my girls has had a crusty knows so I started looking up what might be wrong with them. I then discovered URI. The only symptoms they have is sneezing and one has the crusty nose. They are eating just fine/running around/look happy. I have a vet appointment for them on Thursday (A week from today) but I am not sure if I should push it sooner. Is it possible it isn't URI since they have gone this long with out well....dying? I read it gets bad fast.

TITLE:  What would be the best, $100 graphics card for my rig?
BODY: Currently I am selling my Razer Hydra on eBay and hope to make at least $150 on it. I figured i'd spend the money on a cheap graphics card to help improve my first build. 

Build Specs:
----------------------------------------------
AMD A10-7850K APU
Gigabyte F2A88XM-HD3 Motherboard 
6 Gigs of Ram (one 4gig stick and one 2 gig)
---------------------------------------------

I don't mind doing crossfire with the R7-240 or the R7-250 but if there would be a better option then i will take it. Will seriously appreciate the reply, thank!

TITLE:  Why did Alexander The Great kill Bessus who helped him?
BODY: Alexander The Great conquered Persia in 336 B.C.  The ruler of Persia at that time Darius II escaped the capital city when it fell. With the Persian Empire now effectively under Alexander's control, Alexander then decided to pursue Darius. Before Alexander reached him, however, Darius was killed by Bessus, who was his cousin..

However.. you'd expect Alexander to reward Bessus for killing his long time foe.. instead Alexander captured Bessus and executed him for this, calling it "punishment". 

But why would Alexander do that shouldn't he be thanking Bessus ?

TITLE:  What to stock in my bew 20 gallon tank?
BODY: I learned from my mistake.. took back the 10gal as most of the fish had died anyway. (Petsmart was actually amazing with this problem). So I got a standard 20 gallon tank now. Going to set it up and cycle it. I am looking into fish and REAEARCHING this time. Suggestions for fish please.

I like big bodied fish (as in not slender) 
Willing to do an aggressive tank if paired right

I saw somewhere that a pair of breeding convicts would be okay in a 20 gal tank. Is that correct? Could I put anything else in there with them? How many babies do they generally have at a time?

Suggestions please :)

She was doing this in the little hide house I gave them but I removed it to watch her better. I do have another crab but I've never been through the molting process before and I need to know in order to isolate them. The temperature and humidity are exactly where they're needed to be.

Its been 3 months and it annoys me always feeling it with tongue and just ddoesn't feel natural it feels like glue. Its driving me insane. I wish I could just leave the chipped tooth alone if the bonding breaks off on its own but I dont know how thin my tooth was and if leaving chip alone will chip my tooth much more. Also cap veneer or tooth extraction I deff wont deal with especially since chip I know wasn't that bad. What do I do?  Is driving me absolutely insane!

I went to the YMCA today and went on their running track. 36 laps = a mile and a half. I was able to run 28 laps in 16:55. So I came up short. I've never had good stamina. I'm more of a power kind of girl. I can everything else just not the running. Anyway I can quickly boost this? My boyfriend said to run like a half hour everyday. Think this will work?

TITLE:  Toric contact lenses, far vision blurry.?
BODY: So I have my doubts here, first I am a first time wearer of contact lenses and veteran of glasses, my professional gave me baush+lomb purevision 2, says are for astigmatism, and so far they work ok, not much discomfort after some time of using them that would make up for 2 days of wear, my last check to see my sight accuracy was about a month ago with regular glasses, same used to make my contact lenses, therefore I don't think is the prescription, but the professional that did something wrong but I am not sure enough, so problem is for near stuff like using a computer, reading, of using the phone, that kind of thing vision is perfect, but when it comes to going to drive and looking at a sing on the road is blurry to the point i cannot read it, the further away the worse it gets, so I am thinking that either i still need time to get used to them or the prescription in the lenses is wrong, so are these lenses supposed to provide clear vision from the moment you wear them for the first time or is there something wrong?
Thanks in advance.

BODY: I am house sitting for the people I frequently babysit for. I have known them for almost a year now, and their cat has never been aggressive with me; until about 6 months ago or so. She will randomly attack me and draw blood. They had her fixed and declawed after the latest attack on me. Since then, things have been calm. I have been here for two days and have frequently pet the cat. Then, out of nowhere he bit me hard enough to break the skin and cause swelling. Now she is calm again. I don t understand. Am I doing something wrong? I have never been violent towards the cat. Even when she is attacking me. Help?!

TITLE:  I need a routine for black men hair?
BODY: I've recently decided to grow my hair out. I'm 15 and black, I have black African hair. My routine is usually right after i shampoo my hair 1 a week with a natural moisturizing shampoo i put on my conditioner then after i put on coconut oil. But that's only once a week. I need a daily routine for my hair. Right now all i do is put on my coconut oil when i wake up, pick out my hair with an Afro pick and go to school, and I repeat each day. I feel like I can do something better.

TITLE:  I'm 17 and I want to start ballet soon. Is that okay?
BODY: Ever since I was a kid, I ve been dreaming to dance ballet. But now that I m 17, I am  very motivated to step up. I really want to dance ballet! I can t stop thinking about it and I've never felt so passionate like this before. I really want to try. Dancing makes me so  happy, but I can t find any studio in my city offering adult beginner class. I feel so nervous because if I give it a try, I have to start at level 1 (nursery ballet) with very young girls who are already better in dancing ballet. My soon to be mentor said that I shouldn t feel awkward. Is it okay if I take ballet lessons with little girls who are several years younger than me? I'm not that flexible and I'm a bit chubby but I believe that I have a potential for dancing and I'm very keen to learn. Am I too old? What do you think? :)

There hasn't been not one day I don't think about it. They aren't floaters either, I know what those are but that's not the case here. I need serious answers, or someone who has this problem as well.. Please help, thanks.

TITLE:  How do i improve my basketball shooting skills?
BODY: hello..
i am a highschool graduate who is just about to enter college.
i barely played basketball in high school but i wanna start now so i could have some fun playing basketball in college.

i am definitely one of the best players in my class but that's just because i live in the middle east and basketball is not that popular (unlike football)

my dribbling, defense and rebounding skills are good but my shooting skills are poor.
i have been practicing shooting from the end of the free-shooting circle (the end closer to the basket and closer than the free shooting line) for a few hundred times now and my ratio is about 3-4 out of 10 (and thats my best)

are there any tips for higher ratios?
are there any drills you could recommend?
how many shots (number) should i do before i see some clear results
should i do a swish or a bank shot ?????????????????????????
btw. i am only 5 foot and 8.5 inches 

thanks :D

TITLE:  Will I ever join competitive dance?
BODY: Hi
I'm a 13 year old girl and am planning to learn ballet at a dance studio in september/august around that time. I really want to do competitive dance and I know it's not too late to join but I never danced before (well when I was like 4, 5 or 6) and I have to learn first. When do you think I will be able to join the competitive team at that studio if I try really try my best and do you think I could do it before I'm 16 cause I want to do before high school ends (I'll finish high school at 16 don't ask).

TITLE:  Two of my blood-related cats died and we're scared about a third blood relative of them?
BODY: A few months ago, one of three cats from the same litter died at the age of 1 1/2. A few days ago, another cat from the litter died the same way. We are very scared for the third cat. We don't know if it is leukemia or not, because the first one had perfect health, and the second one was highly allergic to fleas and caused her nodes to swell. The third cat only shows signs of hair loss and scabs, which are allergic reactions to fleas. The last one is 2 years old, and we don't know the condition of the mother. We also can't get the third one tested, as we are running short on money. The third cat only has mild sneezes and other than poor grooming showing no signs of leukemia. Someone please tell me this is a scary coincidence and not leukemia!

TITLE:  I hate getting my haircut? Not because of anxiety.?
BODY: Ever since I was little, I've hated people messing with my hair. It's not because I'm anxious or anything, because I'm not. But it's because I guess I have a really sensitive scalp? Not in like the painful way, because I can literally rip my hair out and hardly feel it, but when other people mess with my hair...its just weird. Like a nerve thing &amp; it makes me jerk involuntarily and it kinda feels like it goes down my back?? I've tried looking it up to see if maybe this was some kind of condition, but I can't find anything. I know it sounds weird, &amp; over the years of me going to get my hair cut, when it happens the hairdressers usually ask if I'm alright and I've just started to tell them that it's because I'm nervous because I know I sound crazy trying to say all that. Anyone know what this could be??

BODY: When I was a kid I was really jealous when I saw someone with long eyelashes and so I trimmed them hoping it will grow longer. I never realized I had long lashes back then and now it's really messed up. Yes it is still long but some are short and some are long. And I really want a thick and long lashes. I also never thought eyebrows these days are the most priority for us girls. I've always had thin eyebrows since I was a kid and they don't have the same length and not identical to each other. What kind of oil can I use for them to grow faster? I honestly want thick eyebrows coz they are easy to groom. Thanks

TITLE:  Can someone help me with basic Gold fish care?
BODY: I won a gold fish at a fair tonight and I don't want to accidentally harm it in any way, I want it to live comfortably as well. I brought a tank for the fish, it's relatively small but there's enough room, the fish is really small. I have a some rocks for the bottom of the tank and some food that came with it. I just need to know some things. How often do I feed the fish? How much do I feed it? Is it okay if I sometimes feed it food other than pellets, such as some vegetables or something. Will it get lonely? How much sun exposure should it get? How often should I clean the tank? What are signs that the fish is unhappy or hurt/sick that I should look for? If someone could answer my questions I would really appreciate it, you can also add your own additional information as well! :)

TITLE:  Gum Disease?
BODY: So before tell you this story, please do not judge me. 
So I never really brush my teeth, until now since I have an expander. The reason why is because when I lived with my bio mom, she never told me to brush my teeth and I was a child at the time so I didn't know (8 y/o at the time, 14 when went to live with grandparents) Now, I feel like it has taken its toll, when I started to live with my grandparents they would always tell me to brush my teeth and I did but not every day like I would probably brush about 3-6 times a month and now with my expander I'm getting the habit of brushing and flossing, but when I brush and floss I start to bleed, but it doesn't hurt. My teeth aren't as yellow as before but somewhat getting white little by little and my gums are like a dark brown/black, white (only in certain spots) and the rest is pink. When I asked the dentist she said I'm probably brushing too hard on my gums but I don't believe her.
My family budget is fine and we have dental insurance so that's no problem.  
I'm just worried,  I'm I alright? Please help :(

BODY: I knows its not any normal teeth extraction and its considered a surgery but holy smokes why the price? I recently got 2 wisdom teeth taken out and cost 1000$. So 500$ each tooth! Is it because of the anesthesia? The drugs? antibiotics? tools used? I am getting another set of 2 wisdom teeth removed and im just really baffled how outrageous the price is. 

Btw im 19, and 3 out 4 of my wisdom teeth are NOT impacted. However, my ortho suggest to get all 4 removed for my braces. Is it really necessary? With all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed, im gonna only have 28 teeth left. Can i not go through with the 2nd extraction?

I actually have experience this before... about 10-13 years ago with pentium 4.
I have 500gb and i installed games on my Drive D and it lags so much...

So i really wanna know the New Updates Today.

If you ask my Spec, i havent set it up yet but its gonna be i7 about 12 GB RAM or 18GB RAM...

I really need a deep thorough Explanation why If Yes Or No.

I dont have any experience with SSD 
But i want it a separate installation
Since i might put more important stuff on C, and D is just purely for games and movies.

10 Points for giving me Good Answer. Thank you!

TITLE:  Is my system not performing as it should?
BODY: Okay, so recently I bought a GTX 650 ti, and upgraded to a GTX 770. I'm using an AMD FX-6300 CPU, with a decent cooler. I don't have anything overclocked because I don't see any point in putting my products in danger for ~2-3 fps. I ran Dying Light and a couple of other games today, and I'm not getting as much performance as I think I should. In Dying Light, I got an average of 55 fps, 67 max, 43 minimum. This is with the lowest possible settings in the game, with only Motion blur and Vsync on. If this matters, I have 6GB RAM which I will be upgrading soon, a decent 500GB HDD, and an MSI 970A-G43 Motherboard. I've seen other people get an average of 55 fps with this game on medium to high settings, so I'm curious what could be going wrong to keep my performance so low. I also ran H1Z1 with the most current update on medium-high settings with about 45-60 fps. Please help. Thanks, -Adam

I have always been the type of person that lays on my stomach when I sleep, so I ve never really woken up with a full mouth of saliva. The last night, I fell asleep on my back and had this mouth full of saliva thing happen. My mouth was closed and I was still breathing through my nose. Is this a common thing for people that typically lay on their backs, or do people normally swallow their saliva throughout the night?

TITLE:  How long will it take for a RPE gap to close?
BODY: I am getting my braces on in 2 weeks along with a rapid palatal expander. My orthodontist said I'll have it in for 2 weeks, but it's going to create a big gap in my front teeth. I don't like the idea of having a huge gap, but if that's what it takes to get nicer teeth it's worth it. I'm just curious about how long it would take for it to close.

That would be fine, but the problem is #1 I'm a guy; #2 It's 8 inches long at the top, so after 6 hours of doing stuff it gets puffy, not to mention when I wake up!; And #3 It takes me 15 minutes to comb, but I have to soak it first. Please help me as I cannot stand having to comb it for so long and that it gets puffy just after a few hours! Not to mention I'll be going to highschool in the fall, and do not want it doing that. Any recommendations for a guy's haircut? Like preppy type. I don't want to shave the sides of top of my head, but I do want it short. Thanks!

I can blur it a little bit,  or I can blur it a lot, and when I heavily blur it, my eyes begin to cross, but not when it's just slightly blurred. I never really asked anyone about it because I didn't know how to explain it. Could someone tell me if this is normal, or if I'm just a wizard? Thanks.

Does it soak through to the shank or is it better to just glue the shank on the inside?

TITLE:  Can I control what I say after I get my wisdom teeth out?
BODY: I m getting my wisdom teeth out in about two weeks and I m wondering what s gonna happen afterwards. 

My mom and brother both hate a boy I ve been dating for almost a year and they don t know we re official. They seriously hate him...whenever I m with him I have to lie about it to my brother and tell my mom I m with a group and he just happened to be there. Bottom line is, I don t want either of them to find out that we ve been seeing each other, going everywhere together, and most importantly having sex. So is there any way I ll be able to control what I m going to say after I get my wisdom teeth out? Because I honestly think they re going to take advantage of me and try to find out all they can while I m loopy....

Also please no answers saying I shouldn t be in a secret relationship or anything like that. I ve been feeling guilty about this for a long time and I ve been opening up more to my mom about our relationship so soon enough I m going to tell her everything that s going on. But he s 18 and I m still a minor, so if they find out something they don t like it s likely they ll try to get him arrested. :( 

Anything helps, I need to know if I can control myself after the surgery! Thanks

TITLE:  How can I get my cat to understand that her sister has died?
BODY: I used to have 2 cats we have 1 left. They were twins.
We had a massive house fire. The sister was trapped  under the sofa and burned to death basically. 

We just moved into a new house and The cat that's still alive is walking around meowing looking confused. Now I don't know whether that's  because she's trying to get used to a new place or if she's looking for her twin?

Will my cat ever understand?

TITLE:  Do I Have Exotropia?
BODY: So, I want to start off by saying I am going to the eye doctor in August for a regular eye exam. Just wanted to get that out of the way, because I know some answers will probably pretty much be, "Go see an eye doctor, or you are gong to go blind." Anyways, whenever I was younger (7,8,9, or 10) I started to notice in pictures my eyes were not centered. I always hated pictures because while everyone else would look fantastic, there would be me with my derpy eyes. But if I was just looking in a mirror I would never notice it. I just turned 17, and it seems like they are getting more noticeable. Whenever I look in the mirror sometimes my right eye will be centered and my left eye deviating outwards, sometimes the other way around, and other times it seems like they are both jacked up. I would include a picture, but I do not feel comfortable posting a picture of myself. Since the internet is all knowing and all that, I started to research a little to try and find out what may be wrong.  I came across exotropia. But it seems exotropia is just when one eye goes outward. Sometimes both of mine look like they are turned outward. I asked my mom a few weeks ago if she could tell that my eyes were any different, but she said that she saw nothing wrong with them. She said that they both looked like they were both straight. I know that at least one of my eyes always deviate outwardly, but it could just be me thinking they they are a lot worse than they really are.

Can the code be edited in order to make my website more visible to customers? Can I make my website more visible without google adwords or some other promotion? Is it possible to edit template code?

TITLE:  Will braces fix buck teeth?
BODY: Okay so I got Damon clear braces today, and I have a bit of buck teeth, and I was just wondering if they would fix my buck teeth well? Or will the braces not make a difference, because my teeth are kind of narrowly structured that's the other reason I need braces. Also my orhtodontist said it would take around 6-9 months to fix my teeth, is it possible that it would only take that quick? My teeth are very straight they are just a bit narrow and stick out a little bit.

TITLE:  Could corticosteroids be a contributing cause for general tooth decay?
BODY: Recently found out i need 3 root canals and have 14 small cavities, all located between my teeth and undetectable to the naked eye looking straight at me. Had a few fillings as a kid but thats about it. Then in the past couple years mine has just gone downhill and nine  of my dental hygiene habits  or fiet have changed too dramatically.  My dentist's opinion was that i dont  floss enough and perhaps eat too much sugar.  The thing is i do floss. Maybe not everyday like brushing. At least 4 or 5 times a week fir sure. Im wondering if my usage of corticosteroids may be the wild card here to explain an otherwise odd case of general decay throughout most if my teeth, albeit to varying degrees . I started  taking prednisolone a few years aho, took it for a year almost daily, now take it as needed when im having a flare up up, and as well ive gotten about 2 steroid shots per year;

And once at 5 weeks. 
I understand that they have a STRONG INSTINCT TO BREED but WHY don't they finish raising young chicks!? 
Ps. They are a challenge to hand feed starting at the older ages. 
If I'm going to hand raise &amp; hand feed I pull the chicks at 2 weeks. Very distressing!

TITLE:  My bf is doing a hair transplant but I am having second thoughts about him doing it?
BODY: He is not bald yet but is balding. If you look at the men in his family you get the idea of what kind of hair line he will have. He is mostly losing hair around the crown and he is 26 years old. I can see that it's really, really bothering him. He's saved money for a hair transplant and is doing one next week. 

Personally I couldn't care less. I love him just the way he is. But he wants to do it. I've called the doctor and his references and all that looks good. But there are still risks and if you read up online you can hear about horror stories. I just think that maybe he shouldn't do it. Is it wrong of me to try and talk him out of it?

TITLE:  Problem with my vision.?
BODY: Hello, about a week ago, i started expieriencing a cloud of what i would guess is an after image. That i think, because it does react to brightness, in dark it appeares light, while in light its dark, so i guess its not floaters. It started one night, when i was sitting at the computer. At first, i thought that its just eye strain, and nothing to worry about, so i went to sleep. When i woke up i realized that it didnt go away, i tried closing my eyes for an hour, and it did a little help, the cloud appeared not as visible. Actually, that day it did dissappear, or atleast went to the far end of my field of vision. Because for a couple of days it did appear for a second, just whenever i moved my eye to the far side. But then, it came back. However, what did scare me, is that yesterday, at night, i went to downtown, and a little spot, like a dot, appeared in my other eye, it looked like a little black hole and sides of it distorted vision, but after about 3 minutes it dissapeared. So now i am really scared, what is happening with my eyes. Before these problems till now i have a slightly red eye, and red veins, with a little pain in both eyes when i blink with preassure. But its not the first time, and i know its from looking too much at the computer screen. So, the interesting question is, what that could be, if it did appear in both eyes.

So what's the best one.

Why all of a sudden is this cat peeing on me and my daughter while we sleep, peeing on anything left on floor (towel, clothes) and now peeing on the table!  I left papers I was filling out on table and they are soaked!  We pay a lot of attention to this cat, she is fed, played with, rarely alone in house because i work feom home but she has her personal space and relaxes all the time.  She is the only cat i have so there is no competition.  SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHY THIS CAT IS DOING THIS??? My daughter is 10 and very gentle with her.  She was litter box trained instantly and remained that way up until a month ago, nothing changed, nothing dramatic happened to cause any stress.

Got my new tattoo a day before yesterday, rinsed it with only water every time, I apply bepanthen twice on that day, none yesterday, and twice today. however when I was pressing it dry with a paper towel it seemed that some color came off onto the towel (happened before today too) and worst, I thought I saw a tiny patch of skin was -- just skin, where there's supposed to be black ink--- what should I do? is it at all possible ill need a touch up? it is on my inner bicep, is that area entitled to free touch up?
thanks.

TITLE:  Is there a hair product with the same affects as chlorine?
BODY: Ok so. I m a swimmer, and I love my hair when its been affected by chlorine, it is thicker and stays together easier. I simply apply a little bit of matte finish clay on my hair everyday to move it around to what I want it to be. Chlorine helps make it ALOT easier to move around, and to stay in position all day. Is there a product similar to this? The nearest thing I can think of is apply a very thick gel and coating my hair the night before, and waking up with my hair kinda where I want it to be and then applying matte, but it still isn t as good as chlorine!

TITLE:  Coloured Marbles in Pavements in York?
BODY: I visited York recently and whilst walking around the city centre I noticed lots of randomly placed (but always in the pavements) marbles/jewels/beads/stones in shaped holes in the ground. They were only small and there were green, white, red and blue ones with white being the most popular. I couldn't work out what they were and wondered what the story behind them was? 
Thank you in advance.

TITLE:  Professional vs. Competition Dance (NYC)?
BODY: Hey all, I live in NYC and know of good professional dance schools but I am looking for competition dance schools for my child (age 7). I can't name one!! Please help!!! I find that competition dancers can actually dance! They pick up choreography quickly and learn new pieces regularly. Professional dance has been a very slow start. I looked into schools like Joffrey, ABT, Peridance, Steps on Broadway, BDC etc. and those kids (my child included although she's at the "top" of her class) still can't do what competition kids do!! I know of older dancers in the industry who work as backup dancers for major artists, on Broadway, as Rockettes etc. and many came from the competition/commercial world. Can someone direct me to a good school? Thanks!

TITLE:  Behind the knee pain lingering on?
BODY: Okay so I play soccer pretty competitively and I am committed to play in college. I'll be a senior come August. A couple of months ago I had some serious pain behind my knee that was effecting my walking but I took 2-3 days off and then it was fine... okay it was bearable. Although there is no sharp pain anymore, it gets extremely tight when I sit with my knees bent for more than a minute. Also I can feel the tightness when I am turning mid run and other times, but there is no sharp, pulling pain. Anyone know what the ligament/tendon is behind my knee that could be the source or any suggestions moving forward?

BODY: Whosurvey.com says that they will pay you $14 per survey, they will pay you for each person you get to sign up, and they will pay you 20% of what they make. It states they will pay you into your paypal once you reach $500 and choose payout. Then after 14 days you will receive your money. The only paypal information that you have to give is when you sign up and then you only provide your paypal email address. My friend got me to sign up by telling me that she HAD recieved money but after I started questioning why I had not been paid yet she quit talking to me altogether. They has been no money transferred to or from my account, but now the people I signed up are mad at me. Do I have a case against whosurvey and the better question is can someone that I signed up sue me? I have had one person tell me she printed everything off and is going to a lawyer monday.

BODY: I tore my meniscus and my ACL last year playing basketball. i had my surgery in july of last year and afterwards i had horrible therapy and a doctor who didn't really care and now almost a year later i still don't have my full ROM because of the scar tissue. and also everytime i try and bend my leg back really hard the inside of my knee where my meniscus is starts to hurt extremely bad. Do you kno how i could effectively break up this scar tissue? and do you have any advice on this pain?

BODY: I always said I could quit at any time, 
That it would be easy, 
But when that time came, 
I knew I was wrong. 

How I thrive to see that sticky, red blood once more, 
Trickle down onto the floor as an ice cream cone on a hot, summer day, 
How I long to feel something again, 
To feel the blade tear into my flesh, 
Making me forget all the pain, 
All the fear, the anger. 

Wanting to say just one more time, 
But knowing one last time, 
Will turn to thousands of scars.

Well, today he broke the stick.
Does anyone know the name of the toy in the picture so I can either purchase a new one or find replacement sticks? It's not the Feather Whirl I know for sure!

TITLE:  How do you backup your files to an external hard drive on an ongoing basis?
BODY: Forgive me for being a dunce, but I can't figure out how to back up my computer to an external hard drive, and then maintain continual data back up. Let me clarify.
I have a Silicon Power external hard drive, 2TB, waterproof, throwproof. I backed up all my files, photos, movies, music, etc. But what do you do after a couple of weeks pass and you need to UPDATE your external hard drive. I don't have time to sit around and painfully back up everything all over again. I just want to back up the "new" files. The external HD that I have doesn't come with an auto backup program, and my PC offers one, but only if you are "using a Microsoft account." Please help. And thank you.

BODY: So I'm 13 and I recently got a sew in for prom. I took it out today (had it for a month) and my hair is really damaged and a lot broke off. My hair was down to my shoulders but now it's not even near it. I usually get perms but I don't want to anymore. I just want healthy long hair. But I feel like If I go natural I will be seen as ugly. There aren't many natural styles (that I've seen) for short hair. I really don't want to be mad fun of at school. What should I do ?

BODY: I would like to build a NAS for my HTPC (Raspberry Pi) but I don't know exactly what parts I should use. I know that this is basically a PC, but I would like to know if I should use any specific parts. I would like this to be a relatively cheap; maximum $300.
I don't need too much storage, I'd say maximum 2terrabytes. I would be using this to store my media for my HTPC, plus for backup for 2 computer.

If you know of any decent builds, please let me know. Thanks.

TITLE:  How to get my cat to loose weight?
BODY: So i have 3 cats, and only one of them is over weight. 
One of them is an outdoor cat and she only comes inside for food, and then goes back outside, she's skinny. She's 9
The 2nd one is the overweight one who is 5. She's an indoor cat, and she doesn't eat more then the other ones, yet she is still bigger then them.. and I mean much bigger.
The 3rd cat is my kitten who is almost a year, and she's skinny and healthy and all is good with that one.
 
But i don't know how to get my 2nd cat to loose weight without cutting off food for my other cats since their food bowls are all by each other and they eat breakfast and dinner at the same time. We do always leave out dry food, and but the one who eats most of it is the kitten.
 Suggestions? 
Thanks in advance xx
