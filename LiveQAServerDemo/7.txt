TITLE:  Tongue piercing?
BODY: Okay so I decided against getting my rook pierced anyway I have a nostril piercing that has fully Healed and it's been done for 1 month and an industrial which has been done for 8 months still not healed 

Anyway I got my tongue pierced, completely random I just thought of it that morning so I didn't research anyway it's been done since Thursday afternoon so it's about 3 days old anyway my tongue started to swell on Friday morning mainly and I'm just wondering if it will swell anymore or if it's swollen as much as it will swell because the bar isn't visible but the ball is and I'm not sure if it's too short if I push it up with my teeth a tiny bit of the bar is visible but it looks like it's left a dent in my tongue at the top ball and I've been using diluted non alcoholic mouthwash or a sea salt - water mix after every meal and before bed, I've been eating as I normally would minus the spicy food I was wondering how long it will take to go down and if it's easy to change once the swelling is gone?? Also if the bar seems to be the right length it also looks like it's Angled so the top ball is further back and the bottom ball is closer to the front of my mouth is that normal??

TITLE:  Miss Teen USA Hair...ponytail?
BODY: I am competing in a Miss Teen USA state pageant. Right now, I am trying to decide how to do my hair for the pageant. 
Currently, I really want to do a bouncy ponytail with a little bit of flowiness and volume in the front to compliment my gown. I know that this is not a typical style for this particular pageant, but I think that it would work nicely, and make me stand out in a interesting way.
Since I am relatively inexperienced with this pageant, I would love some input by someone who is. Would this style be appropriate for the pageant? Would it be okay if I wore it for the whole stage portion? If I where to wear it, would it be okay to add on a fake ponytail? I would love any extra advice that you might have too.
Thank you so much!!!

TITLE:  Very personal insecurity question?
BODY: Before I start, just know that this isn't a troll. I'm really trying to get answers and responses. 
So I'm a 16 year old girl in high school. I'm going to be a junior this year, and I start off with felling you that just to get an idea. I am a virgin. I just started using tampons. But I really insecure about the way I look "down there." There's nothing wrong it is just very unappealing. My labia lips are very saggy... They look like chewed up bubble gum. They're literally so big and saggy it makes it hard to wear bikinis without a weird bulge. Sometimes when walking it needs adjusted. Also I have a lot of access skin around the clitoris area. I read up about it and it said these things usually happen after pregnancy. But I'm a 16 year old virgin. The main reason I don't want to have sex is because I'm insecure. Please give answers.

BODY: I've always had thick eyebrows that grow back when I pluck them but they also get really long and have a slight curl so they're unruly. Unfortunately they're a tad wiry as well - I got them from my dad LOL - but I was wondering how I can manage them. I keep them like Ms. Hepburn's for the most part because I find hers very classic, but like I said before -- they're really hard to manage. Any ideas?

I was just wondering what are some ways to make it go down and what causes it? 
I admit i do mess with it alot since its hard not to. 
Changing from a stud to a ring, will that help? I heard that will relieve some of the pressure. Any suggestions?

TITLE:  Sick Betta fish, please help?
BODY: We ve had our fish for four months and keep him in a filtered tank with a low current. We usually feed him a very small handful of flakes first thing in the morning (6am) and again later that night around 6pm. Lately, he has been hiding in a decorative house or when not in the house he stays at the bottom of the tank in a corner, breathing slowly and doesn t respond to us like he used to. He ate a little last night but swam back into his house and there was still plenty of food for him. I noticed what appears to be some brown/rust colored spots on his body. This behavior is not normal for him at all. Unfortunately his water is at room temperature and we don t have a heater for his tank but change the water once a week or every 10 days.

I think that this will compliment my outfits well and make me stand out in an interesting way. I know that this isn't normal for this particular system, so would it be appropriate? Also, would it be okay to use a ponytail extension to do it? 

Thanks for your time, and if you have any advice, please let me know. Thanks!

TITLE:  Help, I was robbed in Paris, France.?
BODY: A few days ago I got back from my lifelong dream of backpacking Europe for 6 weeks. Just 2 days before leaving I got mugged by a group of immigrants on a subway in Paris. They stole my camera which had over 3000 pictures of my adventures in Europe. It has been devastating. I was approached several times by pickpockets in Pais and knew to yell "non!" and walk away fast. It happened several times. But this time was different. I was targeted, followed, and very afraid. Does anyone know if there's a way, anything to get that camera back. Of course all I care about is the memory card. I'm also having a hard time dealing with the depression and far. I am so angry at myself for letting those men get away with doing this to me. I'm scared to go anywhere. I want those pictures back so bad! Thanks for your time people.

I run a business a business out of my home and want to reduce any amount of cat dander that reaches the 1st floor or basement. They don t leave the bedroom but my family enters and exits at will I suspect spreading the dander. Would a hepa filter help? If so where should it go? Is there much of a risk of it spreading to other floors when they re isolated? What other kinds of things can reduce dander all together?

Is it like a different one they will put in me because I'm not a vergin anymore? My mom doesn't know that I'm not so how do I get it? Will it make a difference if I lie about being a virgin or not? Someone please help! I'm 17

TITLE:  ANSWER PLEASE 10points for the best?
BODY: Me and some friends had a garden party yesterday till night. There was booze and stuff, we were playing games and as it progressed we started to play daring game. I got dared to get a black eye and I was kinda drunk and never had one so I agreed, I also have great pain tolerance. The rule was that it must be visibly swollen. So a friend punched me a few times around my eye as it wasn't swelling, I got nocked twice to eyebrow, twice to cheek bone and maybe three times directly under eye. I kept laughing that maybe I just don't bruise. THEN it started to swell, everyone had a lot of fun pointing out how it keeps swelling up more and making me look asian etc. I started to feel dumb and awkward but I was laughing with them to not look stupid. I was touching my eye and was noticing significant bumps where I got hit, some got to the size of lima bean some to a size of wallnut. Well we were drinking and I went to sleep earlier than the others because they kept laughing at my eye and scaring me I will have a massive shiner. I just woke up with a hangover and swollen shut completely shiny purple black shiner over half my face. I'm scared to show myself to them. Yes it was stupid I shouldn't have drink and do this but I did okay? No need to moralize. My black eye is a punishment enough. I wont do it again for sure. But help me how to face their jokes and laughter. My eye is swelled, hurt to touch and very cartoonishly ugly. They will laugh. Also, how to make it disappear before I go home so my mum doesn't see it?

TITLE:  How do I convince my parents to let our cat be an indoors one?
BODY: My parents got a kitten in July but they're planning on letting it be outside a lot because they think it's a bother otherwise. We live next to a busy road and about half of our previous cats died because of a car accident. (3 of the 8 cats I remember died from an accident, 2 went missing, 1 died from old age and we currently have a male adult one and a kitten.)

I wish they would just stop getting cats if they don't want to keep them inside. They're also against putting a cat-proof fence around our garden because they think it'd be too expensive to put and that it would bother the neighbors because it would be ugly.

When I ask why she can't be an indoors cat, they say it's too much of a bother even though we have plenty of empty rooms. They also think it's cruel to let it be inside all the time. I'm already taking care of all the tasks I can do (litter box, feeding her, playing, making sure she doesn't scratch furniture etc) but they won't give in or specify why it's be a bother. They're planning on letting her be inside all day except at night during the winter and letting her be inside for a part of the day during summer, outside all the time during night.

They don't really seem to care about the cats' lives a lot because my mom once told me "don't worry, we can get a new one if this one gets run over."

I'm 14 and basically don't have any influence.

Any arguments that I could use to convince them?

TITLE:  I made the mistake of getting my first fish tank and not doing the enough research... So now what?
BODY: okay so I Have a 10 gallon tank with tap water and tetra aqua safe. There is a heater set at 78 degrees, a thermometer and a filter. I have one betta fish and a nerite snail. The snail seems to be doing great and the fish not so much but seems okay for now. I have had both of them for a month. 

 

          About a week ago I added a gallon of water and accidentally added way to much aqua safe. it was 5 in the morning so I had to wait a few hours to change the water. I emptied 9 gallons out didn't think to rinse the decorations or the gravel. Then put new water in and the amount of aqua safe for 10 gallons. well a few days later my fish seems to have fin rot. So I went and got a 5 gallon tank with a heater and every thing I need. I put the fish in that just like I did with the 10 gal tank. I got something called life guard from walmart. Its supposed to be a fish cure all.

Is life guard safe?

 does it work?

 is it safe to use in the same tank as my snail?

 are there natural ways to cure the fin rot?

 also when I use the tetra aqua safe it seems to leave a film on the top of my water is that normal? 

how can I cycle my tank and not kill my fish?

 last question... In the future if i get my tank conditions under control in time what are some tank mates that can live with my betta?

TITLE:  Do I have an eating disorder?
BODY: Since I was in sixth grade, I stopped eating at school and slowly began to do the same about all meals at home.  I don't like eating in front of others and I find eating overrated.  After my sixth grade year, people started to notice that I seemed to be somewhat of a perfectionist.  It takes me forever to do test and if something isn't aligned with the object next to it, it becomes very agitating.  Now, I'm going to be a sophomore and this past year,everyone says I lost weight too fast and tell me to eat more.  At first I took their advice but staring purging the food back up.  Say if I ate a cookie or drank a juice box, I felt so disgusted with myself that I threw it up.  I don't like to eat and some see this as a huge problem.  If I am forced to eat, I usually go outside and exercise for hours no matter if it's extremely hot, cold, or raining.  Often times, I've been told I seem obsessed with exercising.  Yes, I count "units of energy" and it's just become an everyday routine for me.  Eating is more like a chore and with that being said, I don't do it very often.  Most days, even during the school year, I only consume half a chewy bar so I can get others out of my head and call it a day.  My Aunt says I have an eating disorder but I don't think so.  She says I don't see it because it's been like this for years and nibbling and exercising excessively seem to be normal now.  I forgot to mention that my friend said my mood has been off and I seem different.  Answers?!?

The lump is located in the bladder/left ovary region

The manager said put 0 down if I wanted more money at the end of the year and 1 if I wanted more during the year and of course I put 1. Back then I was only working 10 hours a week. I since then have moved locations and work 20-25 hours. I read that you have to file taxes if you make more than 5,000 which I probably will now. I also read that I'll probably have to pay back money since I chose 1 instead of 0. Should I change it or what? I just don't want to end paying money next year.

TITLE:  Why is the furry fandom so popular?
BODY: I joined it because it would be the closest thing that would describe me, since all my life, I have always lied to draw anthro lizards holding swords and spears (because I was always big on medieval warfare). But then I went a little further and deeper in the fandom, and I think the culture is really whack. They push all these erotic pornographic furry art in people's faces, and people actually think they are an anthropomorphic wolf or whatever. And they think their voraphilic fetish is normal. It's not normal. A kink is a kink, and they are all equally as weird. I have kinks of my own, but you don't see me shoving all that crap down people's faces. 

You may say "oh the fandom isn't all about the sex" but why do 9 out of 10 furry art sites gear more towards and support the yiff? Why is it when you can just draw 2 little circles together, and 1 long elongated shape above it (half-a**ed drawn penis) it can get more views than those who spend almost months on a drawing?

They popped, and the skin rubbed off.. And I have my first day of school tomorrow. The blisters however, have finally scabbed over.. But I'm afraid that if I wear my shoes, or any of my shoes, they will open back up and be killing me throughout the day.(I'm in high school, so I have to walk around all day..)
Is there anyway to cover them up so the skin doesn't rub off.. They're high up on the back of my foot. The shoes were Sperry's... Do I just use bandaids? I appreciate anyone's answers

TITLE:  My friend is a chronic liar?
BODY: My longtime friend is constantly making up stories about herself that I and others know are not true. Most of them revolve around her mental state. She has self diagnosed herself with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and bulimia when it is more than obvious that she has none of these things. She has never seen a doctor for them and I have called her out on not being professionally diagnosed but she responds "but isn't it obvious enough that I have it?". It's getting to be really frustrating because she constantly brings it up to people. It may be because all of her friends have issues like that and she feels the need to validate herself in the friend group by having issues too. Maybe she doesn't have these issues, but making up your own issues to fit in is a problem in itself. She has lied about chronically self harming, suicide attempts, a Vicodin addiction, multiple mental disorders, and bulimia (just this week she told me she hadn't eaten one thing last week, and I was with her and watched her eat. She told me she threw it up but I have a hard time believing her). She's my best friend but I don't know if I should call her out or just keep agreeing to her fooling people and herself. Is there a name for what she is doing? How can I help her? Thank you.

TITLE:  ****Will a female after turtle always be gravid, or does it depend on the size of the tank? I have a turtle for 27 years and?
BODY: I think its female. She's a southern painted turtle with short claws and she's 6 inches long, but she's never been gravid. I can think of one time she might have been because she was digging like crazy and going nuts. She got sick and we soaked her in a solution and she got better. I don't know if she was egg bound though. So I'm asking, do all female painted turtles lay eggs, or does it depend on the habitat? I doubt my turtle is male, although she did wave her claws in front of the fake turtle like as if doing a male mating ritual.

BODY: I'm going to be a sophomore this year and I just want to know if this plan would work for acting.  I'm not trying to get ahead of myself, but I just want to know if this is a great way to go.

I have been an usher for Xanadu, ensamble for Fiddler on the Roof(5 lines and sang ensamble), Balkan Women Greek Chorus(at least 50 lines, 40 minute show).
I will be doing tech for Driving Miss Daisy, and audition for the spring musical and spring show(this is 10th grade and will also audition for every show, we do three a year, until graduate).  I will audition for acting schools like AMDA, for example(I will audition for a lot of schools).  After, I will work and do shows off-broadway and possibly get an agent after a few years and audition for Broadway and movies.

Would it work?

When I woke up I was fully flaccid and there was semen still coming out. Also, the semen that was out hadn't soaked through my boxers yet. I had to pee really bad afterwards so I went to the bathroom. Usually after a wet dream it takes forever To pee but I peed right away. Is it possible and normal to have a wet dream when flaccid. Should I be worried. 

Btw I don't masturbate and I made this account just to ask embarrassing questions

TITLE:  How do people get discovered and auditions? (Celebs)?
BODY: Everyone says that in order to get discovered you're going to need to go to auditions in LA and have an agent, but there's so many celebs that didn't do that? For example, Selena Gomez went to auditions in Texas for Disney but only moved to LA once she landed the lead role on the show. The same goes to Ariana Grande who came from Boca Raton. I live in Miami and it's really hard finding auditions without an agent or paying a ridiculous monthly fee, that are probably all scams. If someone can help me out, that would be great!!

TITLE:  Why am i always depressed?
BODY: i am almost 22, F... and i dont know why im still always depressed. I feel like i did in high school. I hate myself, and i hate my life for sure.. Ive changed it A LOT too and im still unhappy. Moved out of state, new college... new job... still hating my life completely.

I dont care about anything but my dog to be honest.. I dont care about money, i dont care about food, people, i just do not care. I do care about family and stuff. And i know if i killed myself itd be very selfish of me. But i am suffering each and every day. I catch myself staring off into space thinking about how much i really hate life, and how i wish i could just end it.. I dont understand why i am like this. I dont think there is something wrong with me there is millions of people in this world.. so many of us die anyways.
I dont think theres a problem with wanting to leave soon, i dont like feeling.. happy-sad-mad-etc.. i dont like this roller coaster of life. 

Why am i like this? am i the only one who actually looks at life in the real way??? We arent set here to change the world, were here to reproduce just like an animal. We goto school, graduate, work every single day for the rest of our lives, for what? so what? we can have kids and they graduate and so they can have kids who will also graduate?? This world is nothing, sometimes yes it is beautiful

But life is not worth looking at "beauty"...

I'm considering the purchase of a emama kit and going through with the process and with the hopes of getting some relief. My question is, would it be a good idea to perform this procedure on myself (with an impacted bowel AND WITHOUT MAKING THINGS WORSE) or should I just wait till I can get in to see my doctor, hopefully tomorrow.

TITLE:  How can I start my GoDaddy boutique website? How much money to begin online boutique?
BODY: I'm not sure about all of what I want to sell right now. Thinking Accessories, either celebrity brands or designer brands.

How much much money do I need to start an online boutique? Is $1,200 enough? I m thinking, all I need is the website (1st yr $5/month), supplies (boxes, tape, paper, labels), shipping and products to sell.

So I m thinking supplies will be $150, website $5/month 1st year, shipping (varies, may give flat rate) and products $500 to buy products to sell.

What brands can I buy in bulk? I though celebrity brands may be cheapest. Hard to find celebrity clothing/accessory lines that aren t exclusive to macy s, qvc etc.

I m interested in selling handbags, wallets, candles and perfumes (for women). 

If celebrity products: Beyonce, Betsey Johnson, Rihanna, Iman, Jessica Simpson, Joan Rivers (can t think of any more celebrities). I m not sure if they sell all the items i want nor do i know if they d sell to me.

If NON-celebrity products: Guess, DKNY, Dooney &amp; Bourke, Nine West (i dont know any more brands).

Oh and instead of using my home address should i use a post office (P.O box) address? 

Please help!

TITLE:  Hi, my name is benjamin and I just got contacts on Friday the 7th of August. But now they hurt and its only my third day?!?!?
BODY: The docter gave me a trial pair and the first day they felt fine. Then the next day I put them in and my eyes turned red instantly, and they kept moving out of place and I kept feeling them in the corners of my eyes and then they started to itch and irritate my right eye! I have an astigmatism in my left eye and it feels fine but my right eye hurts. Both eyes turn red and so I took them out and now today is the third day I'm supposed to wear them and I put them in this morning and my eyes once again turned red instantly and my right contact started to hurt instantly. I can't go to the docter till tomorrow, Monday cause my docter is closed on the weekend so I don't wear them. Are they supposed to hurt on the second and third day or are the trial pairs they gave me not working, or is it the solution?  I did every thing the dicter told me to, I wore them for a short time the first day, took them out and cleaned them and put them in the case, and then put them in the next day but I couldn't wear them for the whole time, they just hurt to much when I put them in. I want to wear contacts because I don't want to wear glasses but if I don't pass this trial run the docter won't let me wear them. What should I do?!?!

TITLE:  Emotions registering late?
BODY: Ok so my brother got into a car wreck. It was at about 2am. I was a little drunk but not quite there. He was maybe a half mile down the road with a friend who was completely drunk that had rode in the passenger seat. The friend came running back and told us what had happened. Now what I'm wondering is. Right when I found out about it and ran down the road. I couldn't bring myself to cry or feel anything really. But the next day at work I felt like it all hit me and I wanted to cry even though my brother was pretty okay. Just possibly has a concussion. Was it because I was kinda drunk. Or is it because my feelings just somehow registered late after all the shock of what happened? Is there some word for it maybe? Thanks!

TITLE:  Whats wrong with my cats?
BODY: most of my cats (5 outdoor cats, specifically) all have diarrhea, lack of appetite, and some if not all of the 5 have black specks in their mouths (my 2 cats inside also have the black specks). aside from these things, they all look and act perfectly fine; though a bit depressed. i had to move to an unpleasant location in june, and the 5 cats outside have all had to live in small pens together, whereas they used to have the freedom to roam anywhere they wanted indoors and outdoors. idk if stress may be the cause of these problems or if its the heat. i am having severe financial problems right now and may only be able to afford to bring one cat the vet within the next month, but not right away. i would like to know if this is something i can afford to fix for them or if i need to start looking for rescues to send them to. my cats mean the world to me, we have just fallen on hard times

TITLE:  I cut myself... for fun?
BODY: I know it sounds bad, but hear me out. I do struggle with my own issues, and was self-harming with rubberbands and scratching before this. I use a sharpener blade and I currently have about 12 cuts. 8 on my left wrist, and 4 on my right upper thigh. The thing is, I do it because I like the stinging and the scarring, and the blood. It's weird. I do feel empty and guilt afterwards, though. But its like, I don't do it for relief, solely because I want to. I find myself obsessing over my cuts.I don't want anyone to find out, and my parents have been questioning me about my bandages. I don't feel loved at all, and I feel like I don't belong. I see a counsellor, and am have made an appointment to see a team of psychologists as well as psychiatrists. (I have had one psychotic episode). Is there an actual reason for all this? (Besides possibility of depression)

This has been going on for 4 days but I've been on pills for only 2 and I noticed I had a lot of pus on the back of my throat? Can an ear infection cause pus on the back of the throat or do I have something that's not strep that I need to get looked at again?

TITLE:  Eating Disorder? *10 Points*?
BODY: Basically for the past 8 months, I've been binge eating and making myself throw up on purpose straight after. I don't do it to lose weight, Its mostly because I feel guilty and regretful about what I've just eaten and the though of all them calories sickens me. But I can't stop I'm in a horrible cycle which I just want to break. I restrict my calories fine, But then I binge and then purge, Straight after (Next day) I put myself on a strict diet to try and stop it, But it happens again and again. I've lost weight, I'm also overweight, In the past 8 months I've lost 4stone, Which is around 56lbs. 

I'm spending all my money on binges, I sometimes go on binge shopping trips with the intention to throw up. I have Social Anxiety and Depression also. 

I have such bad self esteem about myself, I'm constantly feeling low all the time about my weight. All I think about is food 24/7 I thought purging would give me some control. And it did at first, But now I really can't stop. I weigh myself every morning and night, Sometimes throughout the day. 

Sometimes I think maybe I'm not sick enough for help, Or I am doing this all for attention. Or maybe I don't deserve help because I'm Obese and I brought this upon my self and deserve all this because I'm just plain greedy. 

This lady I saw for my depression, I told her and she referred me to a eating disorder place for help. But question is, What ED do I have? I mean why would she refer me there without mentioning it? 

Opinions please :(

TITLE:  Does this sound like erectile dysfunction?
BODY: I've been dating this man for awhile and we just started having sex two weeks ago. Before we had sex he told me he could only get hard if I didn't shave down there so to please him I did just that ...

 His sex drive and mine are different, mine is very high and his isn't, he made me aware of this and I was ok.

He remains flaccid with blowjobs and handjobs. In fact, he's told me he doesn't enjoy either and can only stay erect during intercourse. Even then, it's hard -- in between flaccid and erect. He also doesn't last very long. I attempted to coax him for a second round but he told me he's too old. He just turned 40. Here are some other things, he drinks heavily and states it's due to his job -- he's a lawyer and thus he claims it's due to high stress. 

I've had one other sexual partner (I'm 30 btw) and he was 38. I remember it was different, he both had a high sex drive and he could get hard and last long, so that's my comparison. Plus, due to the fact that he is a professional athlete he neither drank nor smoked.

Does he have erectile dysfunction or is he just not into me?

The story has humorous elements. There were two guys who plan a sneaky bank robbery. They use sewer tunnels to reach the bank's vault but when they finally surfaced, they realize that there's yet ANOTHER bank robbery (an armed one) going on with police forces outside, securing the bank. Robbers doesn't see them emerging from the tunnel, but some hostages do. When one hostage asks the original robbers about their identity. The leader of the duo wrongfully calls himself a secret agent of sorts and that his name is EDWARD DE DUM! He couldn't think of a better name! I don't remember anymore, I fear.
It was definately humorous! Too bad, I don't remember the writer's or the story's name. Can anyone help me?

TITLE:  If a couple who share the same hpv virus, should they wait until one of the partner s genital warts are clear before resuming sex?
BODY: My boyfriend found genital warts in January and got checked and doctors confirmed it was hpv genital warts. He was given a cream and began treatment and we stopped having sex. I later had my annual pap and check up and doctor said I most likely had it too though I didn t have warts, then results came back HPV positive. We can t really know who had it first and who gave it to who.. It s now August and he is still treating warts and we have remained abstinent. He has a couple left and hopefully seems to be towards the end of the outbreak. We are aware of how long it takes for the virus to clear our bodies and that we can t pass it back and forth or make virus worse, however, should we keep waiting for his warts to go away to have sex? If we had sex now would that make me get warts too even though I already have the same virus?

I have a TON of stress, thinning hair, AND I am severely unhealthy!  So if anyone should be gray, I'd think it'd be me.  Genetics may be it, as my mom didn't start turning gray until her mid 50's...

BODY: What (and who) is responsible for the death of Mr. Wright?
Why was he killed?
Mrs. Hale, in response to Mrs. Peters’ assertion that “the law has got to punish crime,” answers, “I wish you’d seen Minnie Foster when she wore a white dress with blue ribbons, and stood up there in the choir and sang”; and she then adds: “Oh, I wish I’d come over here once in a while! ... That was a crime! Who’s going to punish that?” (23). Is Mrs. Hale guilty of a crime? Why does she think she is?


I couldn't seem to find these answers.

BODY: My mom had a baby on Thursday, and we brought her and the baby home yesterday. We have a 95-100 pound boxer, and we thought he would just maybe watch over her, you know normal stuff. But every time me or my siblings try to touch the baby he growls, and gives us a very alert mean look. He has bitten me before , but it was my fault. Yesterday my sister went to touch her, he growled and she didn't see him but I did. He lounged over my mom and the baby and tried to bite her. He is such a sweet dog, I have never seen him like this. It is very scary. I knew he was going to do this but no one really believed me. What should we do? Is there a trainer that we can see? The last thing we want to do is get rid of him. He is my very first dog and I love him. Please help us. And just incase I am 13, my brother 15 (almost 15) sister 17. Please help, and give tips.

She had a normal poop, then diarrhea, then something like the squirts and the last time she tried to poop out it had bright red blood in it. The only thing I can think is she licked off the neosporin I put on a cut per vet recommendation. Is the bright red blood dangerous? our vet isn't open today so would she be okay to wait till tomorrow?

I am using iMovie and changing the settings during the export like all the outline tutorials out there say to do. MPEG-4 video, AAC sound, selected "Best" for quality, and with dimensions of HD 1920 X 1080.

What gives? PLEASE help as I am rather passionate about developing my YouTube Channel.

TITLE:  I had severe diarrhea this morning that has left me with a terrible pain in my stomach. What's wrong with me?
BODY: The pain is very distracting; I can't function or get anything done. It seems like a mix between a full blown cramp and an intense burning. The sensation is strong enough that it seems to be pulling all the way to my back, making my upper back hurt. My diarrhea is gone, but the stomach pain just seems to be getting worse. I did some of my own research online, and there were several other people who described my symptoms perfectly, but with no real results of their own. One woman even described her stomach as feeling swollen when she pressed on her abdomen, and mine feels quite swollen too - like it would feel after I'd eaten a big meal (even though I haven't eaten anything in around 15 hours). I burp occasionally and it tastes strongly of stomach acids.

I've had severe and painful diarrhea before, but it's never left my stomach in such an awful state. What can I do to get rid of this pain? I'm almost afraid to eat anything due to the "cramping" sensation like when you're vomiting.

I know that the rose in general can symbolize beauty love all that blah blah and thats what I want it to symbolize. But that rose colors have different meaning also. By getting a black and white tattoo do you think people will just interpret it as a rose in general? Or do you think it will be portrayed as a black rose which symbolizes death etc?? Spare me the it doesnt matter what other people think comments pleaseee. I just want opinions on how you think it will be portrayed, Thankss!!

TITLE:  Injured ulna? (On the side of my pinky finger)?
BODY: Okay first I would like to say that I know that this is not a substitute for a doctor, I just am the type of person to go on webMD before I go into an appt. so I can mentally prepare myself for the options. This story is honestly embarrassing, I am a 17 year old girl on summer break, last night I was dancing in my room to music and I went for a jump and ended up hitting my right arm on the ceiling fan above me. The ceiling fan was on and moving at full speed, I immediately turned off the music and just kind of held my arm in shock. Pain didn t set in until about 1 minute after, it doesn t feel too severe. Swelling, and there s a scratch on my skin from the fan, there s tenderness to the bone when I touch the spot it hit, and pain. It isn t keeping me from functioning on a daily day, so I m not sure what the injury could be. Could it be a sprained arm/wrist, or a tiny fracture? Opinions would definitely help, I tried to google search "hit arm on ceiling fan" and barely anything came up. And everything that did come up said they didn t think it could have enough impact to break an arm, please help!!! (I am going to doctor soon as well don t worry)

It hurt for a bit and then was just sore. I was sort of out of it for a few hours and was very tired but I usually am at work. I had a mild headache and then the next day there was no headache just drowzieness and now today I have a slightly more mild headache and the spot is still sore to the touch. When I talk I can feel my sinuses vibrate also and I'm also on Advil. The spot is also red. Is this a slight concussion with internal bleeding or just a bump?

TITLE:  New born babies and pit?
BODY: So my baby daddy lives with his dad. His dad has a pitbull which I don't like because I've never been a fan of animals. Well, his dad got the pit when he was a pup and is now only a few months old. I've heard a lot about how mean pits are and how they are the #1 top dogs that turn on their owners. My question is, is a newborn baby safe around a pit bull, especially a pup because all he does is jump and tear everything up!! My baby daddy and i are having an argument over it and he says it all depends on how people treat their animals. If people treat them bad then the dogs are gonna grow up mean. I know his dad loves animals and I know his dad is good with the pit, I'm just terrified that one day I lay my baby down and the pit jumps on her or attacks her thinking she is a toy!!!! Please help me and ease my mind!!!

TITLE:  Will I like Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte or Emma by Jane Austen? Is East of Eden as good as billed?
BODY: Finally getting in on summer reading (going into 12th grade AP Literature class) and having trouble deciding what book to read. Most of my friends chose East of Eden, which they all love, but I hate Steinbecks style or writing. The landscape descriptions put me to sleep. I couldn t get through 50 pages of Grapes of Wrath before I quit... So now, I ve decided it might be interesting to go outside the box and read either Jane Austen or Emma. I m a guy who loves Scandal and The Notebook, and watches the Bachelor shows and stuff of that nature, and I m wondering if either of those books will be at all similar to a modern day RomCom? Thanks!!

BODY: I'm starting college this fall. I'm thinking of going into either aerospace or mechanical. My family is an Apple family, so I've only used mac computers. I'm looking for something that would be under 15" and rather light weight. I was looking at getting a MacBook Air or a Surface Pro 3, but I'm not entirely sure. If these are good options, could you suggest some good specs for them? Like how much RAM is needed and should it be i7 or i5. Thank you!!!

TITLE:  Is it weird for a guy to wear fake glasses?
BODY: For a guy that focuses on his style, I take my appearance very seriously. I work on all of my style. But all my efforts are lacking one thing, good face structure. My forehead has a ridge above my eyes that is not totally unsightly, but could be fixed with some fake glasses that would shape up my forehead. I've tried on some frames and they make me look much better than before. What do you ladies in particular think of guys wearing fake glasses? Since this world is super focused on appearence I believe that it is important to try to make your appearence look better. It's the key to social acceptance. So anyways, what do you people think of fake glasses for appearance purposes? By the way I'm 14 and I don't have any problem with vision.
Thanks

TITLE:  Getting fat?
BODY: I know this will sound crazy to some people but ever since I can remember I have always wanted to know what it's like to be overweight. The way I see it is if I don't do it it will always be on my mind. I don't want to be hugely overweight but it would be nice eating whatever I wanted for a couple of months and getting a bit chubby so I can finally stop obsessing over it. So my question is if I am fairly slim now how long would it take me to but on a substantial amount of weight so that it is clearly noticeable and how hard would it be to loose it as I do not intend to stay overweight? Please no nasty comments, we all have weird obsessions and fantasies and I'm not hurting anyone here I just need advice. Thanks :)
-also I am a 21 year old female if that makes any difference

Cause they are getting paid peanuts now compared to what they made before. I really don't like this Reebok deal, only a small percentage of fighters are getting a good deal from this.

BODY: I have deleted TONS of music, apps, and pictures. I've cleared my downloads list and even tried removing updates for apps I can't uninstall but never use. Here's the huge problem, once I delete something, I can't replace it. Say you delete Pandora for extra room. Afterwards you try and reinstall it but the phone tells you that you don't have efficient memory storage for that app. Where did the memory space that you just emptied fo? No idea. This is driving me INSANE.

TITLE:  When will I stop growing?
BODY: I asked this question a few minutes ago, but it says that it's been deleted for violating rules...? Whatever. So I am gonna ask it again. Hello every1. I am a little over 13 1/2 and I am nearly 5"6. Every women on my moms side is shorter than 5"6 (other than my non blood related aunt who is 5"6.5) and every girl on my dads side is 5"7 or under. I don't mind my height. I always wanted to be 5"6-5"7, a little taller than average. It's just that I'm a little concerned that I will continue to grow until I'm like 16, but I doubt that. Ik that I'm just an early bloomer since my whole body is really developed, not just in height. My mom (5"3) stopped growing at the end of 8th and my aunt (she's on my moms side and every1 says we have the same body build. Also, 5"5) said she stopped growing by the end of 7th. On my dads side, I don't really know because I don't talk to them much but I do know that one of my older cousins stopped growing at 14 at the height of 5"6.5. Me, well I'm going into 8th in a couple of weeks and I haven't grown at all this summer, so I'm feeling pretty confident that I won't grow much more. Idk if this is important, but I got my period in February or March of 2015 and last summer (2014) was my huge growth spurt. Like no joke, I grew at least 4 inches in just 3 months we had off. So, do you guys think I'll finally stop growing for good soon?

But here's the thing, I've heard from various sources that rings hurt worse for first getting and heal faster. Is there any way I could try and make her allow me to get a ring instead of a stud first?

TITLE:  Unity vs Unreal Engine?
BODY: Hey guys, I am looking to make an open world game. I am torn between Unity and Unreal Engine. I don't know which to use. Firstly, I don't know C++, but I do know C# (1 point for Unity), but then again, the programming isn't SO important with the visual scripting, which ties them up at 1-1.

My specs are pretty good, but nothing amazing, I have:

CPU - i5 4570
RAM - 10GB DDR3
GPU - AMD HD 7770

Will I be able to run both Unity and Unreal smoothly? This is going to be a big game, so I don't want any lag when trying to program it.

What about graphics? Does the one have better graphics than the other? Unity definitely seems to have inferior graphics in my opinion but is that true? Is it perhaps up to the skill of the modelers that decides the graphics quality?

There we go guys, what do you think will be better for me? Unity or Unreal Engine?

Thank you

TITLE:  Car broke down less than 2 weeks after Buying !!!!!?
BODY: Me and my girlfriend bought a 2002 mazda 626. It was running fine checked it out took it on the express way everything was fine so we bought it "as is". Now we didn t drive it after that for about a week and a half. When we started driving it the wheel was shaking anytime we were sitting still in the vehicle. About a week later we were going downtown on the express way &amp; the car cut out !! There was smoking under the hood, so we let the car cool down popped the hood &amp; the radiator cap was off. I noticed the oil and coolant were low so I topped both fluids and let it sit for about a hour. Tried to fire it up but nothing. All I hear is clicking when I turn the key. I even tried to get a jump but nothing ! I had to get the car towed my mechanic came and looked at the car he says he did a compression test and the engine isn t getting any compression. He recommends getting a brand new engine. Is there anything I can do to have the dealer replace what s wrong ? I hasn t even drove the car 3 weeks and it s time for a new engine ?? Sounds fishy to me is there anything I can do ?? I did buy it "as is" with no warranty but a engine going out that quick there had to be something wrong with it when I bought it. Please help !!!!!

TITLE:  Gaining upper body muscle...?
BODY: I'm 15 years old standing at about 6'0, 6'1 and 180lbs. I recently purchased a curling bar that is 10.4lbs I believe and I started to lift the bar with 2, 5lb weights, one on each end, so it's about 20lbs all together. My question is... what type of curls should I do, where should my hands be, how should I lift it, etc. I do some basic stuff that my dad showed me, about 10 times each and about twice a day if I can... I'm not trying to become a body builder, just want some muscle and not skin and bone arms. How long will it take for my biceps / triceps to increase in size? Thanks.

TITLE:  I have feelings for my neighbour?
BODY: I am a westerner girl and living in Seoul for like 9 months. in my apartment there is a korean guy that lives alone as me. we dont have a so much communicate but we greet each other when we see each other. I like him and want to know him more. my korean is not super good but i can speak easily and still improve. 
And, the sad part...
I have heard that korean people are very conservative. for example, generally they don't want non-korean wives, brides. maybe girl/boyfriends. well, does it mean I have almost no chance about him? will he care about cultures and nationality? and even if I improve my korean and have no communication problem? some of my korean friends say "we dont care about that" but I don't know if they say it just because i am their friend. 

I know everyone has a different personality, but as a Korean, would you make a generalization? or what would you do? would it be a big deal? 

ps: if you are racist, get out of here. I am tired of seeing you arrogant people. just go away. I want to read polite comments of my polite Korean friends. no need to your irritating comtempts. thanks!

TITLE:  A day At the boxing gym?
BODY: I was at the boxing gym last month.
I got this big, loud mouth woman one time, blabbing her head off that my career is over, that she's going to send me back to the "burbs" and all this and that... and that she's going to knock me into next week...

The coach kept telling me, you don't want fight a woman...

So I said to the coach.... and to the guys down there holding her back...

"let her in, let these motherf)uckin' bullsh!t games begin... this dumb b)!tch thinks she's a man...  bring her fat *** into this 
b)!tch"

They let her go...

She climbs into the ring...  

I busted her face and her ribs up in the corner.

Then I dragged her into the ring bloody, and I told her to go do what you "equal women" do best...
Go complain to CNN that you got whooped by a man.

TITLE:  Problem with window unit air conditioner.?
BODY: Having a problem where my window unit A/C compressor will not stay engaged, it will come on for roughly 5-10 minutes (not nearly enough time to cool the room) before shutting back down to fan only. Also the unit becomes very noisy just prior to the compressor shutting off. Coils never get cold or show any signs of moisture, but I suspect this is just because it's not running long enough. It's an older unit, maybe 15 years old. I'm not entirely lost when it comes to some aspects of general maintenance and repair, but don't know much about air conditioning yet. I am suspecting the run capacitor would be the cause for this? Does this sound correct or could it be another issue? Worth fixing or time to replace?

I have a 15 year old Connemara mare and she's impossible to get onto the bit I have tried different rains and restraints but none of them work. Does anyone know of any special exercises or techniques I can use to get her to go down onto the bit easier or anything to help build the top muscles in her neck? She is capable of doing it as sometimes after a lot of work or galloping she will go down into it without even realising! But I need her that once she goes down onto it she will stay down. Thank you ☺️

Should I order 2 more bulb from the hid nation to see if it changes to the deep blue? Also my power for my fog lights are off my altinater and my headlights are off the original cord for head lights wonder if that has any effect?

TITLE:  Is it impractical to wear white, beige or other light colored clothing to cooking classes?
BODY: Moved the question to the general cooking category, because the fashion section didnt worked so well..

In fall, Im going to take cooking classes and never gone to those before so thats why Im wondering. 

When Im cooking or baking at home, I usually wear things that i wear to sleep in, so Ive never pay attention to getting them ruined.
But when commuting to somewhere else, I like to wear my everyday wear clothes (and there was a dress I wanted to wear) but start to wondering about the "clothes might get stained" incident that may happen when cooking, so yeah.

TITLE:  How can I cope with my stress, paranoia and anxiety when things are eating me up?
BODY: I'm a very laid back person but I'm always worried and I always expect the worse even though I'm always very positive and happy. I worry about myself a lot and mistakes I've made and if they'll come back to haunt me or something. I'm still young so I don't want to ruin my life before it even starts. I just made a few mistakes that make me paranoid and stressed. I'm not weird and sad and depressed or anything I just always worry and feel like every time someone says something related to what I did is about me. I guess I just have a guilty conscience. You guys ever made a mistake and feel like it's eating you up inside. Maybe I'm overreacting or maybe this stuff is really gonna bite me in the butt. What do you guys think? How can I cope with this?

TITLE:  How do I get my guinea pig to be comfortable with me?
BODY: I ve had my guinea pig for about 10 months now and he is still not used to me. when I first got him I know that I came on a little strong I started picking him up when he wasn t used to his surroundings and I know that I should ve waited, but I was so excited and I didn t realize how careful you have to be around them when you first get them. I just moved him into a larger cage (C&amp;C)  because it came with a really small one you get from pet stores. He is more skittish now lately. It has been a week since I moved him in but while I was building it I put him in and out of it. Is he still getting used to the cage? I know that guinea pigs have to have a bigger cage so I don t think I have a choice to move him back to his smaller one. Since I can t move him back and if he is still getting use to it how do I get him to be comfortable with me and my family? I love my guinea pig DJ and I hate that he is so jumpy around me. He is in my room and every time he sees me move he jumps. If you could help that would be great. Thank you so much.

And another question if they did come stock with out a booster is it easy to install one so there is one.

Never heard of this with time warner I use almost 400GB every month and they've never mentioned a cap. my question is is if there a good Internet provider that doesn't have a cap or should I stay with time warner

TITLE:  Is it morally ok to get a similar tattoo to someone else?
BODY: The thing is I fell in love with this tattoo a singer in a band has, but I of course would never copy it but I really really like it. However there are things in it I would like to change like one of the main colors involved, pattern, and design. It's essentially the same tattoo but very different if you can grasp what I'm trying to say.

 It's like saying two people draw a car but the one drawing the second one drew it differently with a different color, shape, brightness, etc. It's a pretty common tattoo but I feel like I would be copying it somehow since I first got the idea from the singer.

TITLE:  I need help with my Chinchilla's fur problem?
BODY: I have a female Chinchilla who is about five years old. She is a rescued Chinchilla. She was used for breeding but I took her in when she would not breed and the breeder did not want her anymore. She was in bad shape when I got her. Her fur was a mess. She was pretty overweight. And she could barely hop around. She couldn't jump at all for awhile. But now I have had her for a year and she has gotten a lot better. She can jump and she isn't so scared of everything. Her fur does look much better but she keeps shedding a lot. And I mean like chunks of hair come out. I have another chinchilla and his fur doesn't do that. I know they shed a lot but my other chinchillas fur doesn't come out in chunks like that. I've been giving them dust baths and everything. I am trying to find a vet that knows chinchillas but so far none of them know much about chinchillas and can't help. I am worried about her and don't want anything bad to happen to her. What could this be? Could it be the chinchilla food I get? Is she missing a vitamin or something? Please do let me know. Thank you.

All the greats practically, even Stephen King had to work as a teacher and laundry mat associate for years before "carrie" took off.  My dream is to be a full time fiction author but if it doesn't work out and I can only do it as a second job, what jobs do writers do to make a living?  As a writer, what qualifies them for what?  Like if they had a degree in journalism, creative writing, English ed. or along those lines?  

Not everyone can be an engineer or doctor...I've tried...

BODY: I'm going to be honest with you. I'm not too exposed on a lot of stuff. The only things I watch on Youtube is motivational videos and music. I need to broaden my horizons and it make my likes more watchable. I look at other guy's likes on their youtube channels and they're more broad, stronger and better than me. Mine is weak &amp; boring. I tried watching a lot of TV but there's nothing on. This explains why I dont talk because I dont have nothing to talk about. But please tell me how can I be more exposed to more stuff so it'll be easy for conversation and how can I make my youtube playlist interesting?

TITLE:  Does it matter WHEN I go to sleep?
BODY: I don't exactly get to sleep at a normal time. Instead of going to bed at 12am or 1am or something like that, I usually stay up all night and go to bed at 7am-ish. My mother worries and doesn't think it's healthy. But, even though I get to bed so late, I still get a proper amount of sleep everyday. I go to bed at 7am-ish and get about 8 or so hours of sleep. I'm sure it's not a good habit to have (I blame college), but is it physically unhealthy to go to bed at this time even if I get a proper amount of sleep each time?

TITLE:  How do I convince my parents to buy me the Miranda Sings book?
BODY: Miranda Sings made a book and it came out a couple of weeks ago. The book is supposed to be funny and I really love Miranda and I'd love to support her. 

So yesterday I asked my dad to get me the book since its on sale at Barnes and Nobles. He said yeah and I gave him the title and all. He seemed pretty enthused about buying it because, I absolutely hate reading and I haven't finished a book in 3 years (I read some, but stopped).

I almost have enough money to get the book (I'm only 13). 

Well, my dad was going to get me the book but he didn't. I asked him "Was it still on sale" and he said yes but he felt that the book was stupid and I shouldn't be reading it. I told him its supposed to be a joke but he said he's not wasting any of his money on the book.

I just really want to get the book in support of Miranda and I also realllllly want to read it (LEGALLY).

BODY: I'm trying to get a used truck by using my car as a trade in. The issue is, that I seem to be getting a uniform roughly $1,000 trade in credit for my car (via KBB, Edmunds, etc). 

I have service receipts for RECENT timing belt kit (belt, tensioner, waterpump), serpentine belt+tensioner, and motor  mount replacement within the last 10,000 (ten thousand) miles. I have done a tune up myself (spark plugs and wires) and still have the old parts to prove it. How much increase in the trade-in credit should I expect if any?

TITLE:  Why did this cat react like this when people petted him?
BODY: ok so in my college class we visited our professor's house and she has a cat. usually he's pretty friendly and all. well today we noticed that he was licking himself a lot. nevertheless he was fine. 

well then i was petting him on his head and he didn't care, but then i started to pet him past his head, and then as soon as I did that, he turned, looked at my hand with huge eyes as if he was horrified, and then he made like he was gonna bite, so I left him alone. he then started licking himself again, especially where i just petted him. he did this to me one or two times, and he did this to at least 3 or 4 of us in our very little class. 

usually he's fine with us petting him and sometimes even curls up on our lap. but tonight not so. he obviously wasn't sick and was healthy.  we didn't touch or handle anything different, and we weren't teasing him

I've been in a depression about it because it's what I've always wanted, and it's been taken away from me by my disease. However, over the past few days I thought about trying to become an astronaut. I completely forgot about that. I think I'd love to go into space and study things and take pictures and so on. Not sure whether the height matters but I'm 5'9", and I wear glasses. Anyways, can I still at least try be an astronaut with my CF?

It doesn t hurt or burn when I pee, it is just a constant burning like it s really hot. I am a teenager, and this same thing happened about a year ago. I went to a MedExpress and they gave me some sort of pill that numbed my nether regions, made my pee orange, and the burning went away in about a week. I also jist got off of ny period. I can t remember if the last time this happened I just got off of my period also. I was just wondering if anybody has had the same thing happen to them, and what it was.

TITLE:  Help, I want, but can t get a cat! What can I do?
BODY: I m an undergraduate college student, and I really want to adopt a pet cat from my local shelter.

TITLE:  Deep filling 3 materials used?
BODY: I had a tooth that needed a deep filling(top side molar) some side had broken off too my new dentist has filled it and he says used 3 materials some being amalgam to seal the root  then another material but unsure what then lastly he put composite filling on top and side,this tooth looks restored and pain has vanished but am now i am concerned on how long composite is going to last me?  no other dentist has ever been able to sort the pain in this tooth out in years so am pleased with result but wondering will composite crumble and spoil the results? meaning decay under it later on? but if it did then surely the 2 other materials under it can stop decay getting to the root?
anyone ever heard of a dentist using 3 materials before?

TITLE:  Should I go through with my circumcision?
BODY: I am 19 years old and for the past couple years of my life I have been dealing with the dilemma of whether or not to get circumcised. A lot of people on the internet make good points for both sides. I am not in need of one from a medical standpoint. However, when erect, I am not able to fully retract my foreskin for a smooth sliding motion during sex. If not careful the skin around my frenulum will swell up and hurt a bit. I noticed that I can t fully retract it because of my frenulum and I know getting a circumcision will solve that. I am just not sure if I should get the procedure done or not.

It's not my stomach, because it hasn't gotten bigger and is completely flat. I've also weighed 121 pounds (I'm 5 foot 6) since my 9th grade year and I still weigh exactly the same weight (my weight at the doctors matches the past few years) yet now, I can barely fit into size 3 jeans! They're the same brand I've always worn, but I suddenly can't wear 0 anymore! Does anyone know why?

Im going to the London White and Maggard and I need braces fast, Im kinda scared they will make me wait about 2 months. If anyone has been to the London, KY one, please tell me what they do!

TITLE:  What do I do to get the mint green out of my hair?
BODY: 5 months ago I dyed my hair a mint-to-blue ombre color with Ion and now it faded all to a very very light mint with a few patches of brassy yellow. Also there's that weird patch of blue in the back of my head where it shouldn't be. School is starting in a few weeks and I want to surprise everyone with silver hair. My cousin said that he might have to bleach it out of my hair, but in the process of going mint, I already bleach my hair white after getting rid of my ugly orange. I had to do it 8 times. And I used Clariol White with a 30 vol cuz my teacher wanted to be safe. The last 2 or 3 times, we switched to 40 vol. Surprisingly, my hair didn't break off to the point where my length went away. Anyway, after my ombre faded once, I had a touch up. And now that the touch up is totally faded, I want to go silver. Any suggestions on what brand of color remover or any other method besides bleaching?

TITLE:  Did I Put In Too Much Water Conditioner?
BODY: So today I got my first betta fish. My mom put in 5 drops of conditioner in my 2.5 liter tank. It has this little filter at the bottom which was covered by my plant decor. So, I then moved the plant (by dipping 2 fingers in to move it) to the side. I then got worried I might've contaminated the tank so I searched up if I needed to put in more conditioner. It said to put in a few drops so of course, I did it. I put in 2-3 drops. I'm actually worried I put in too much, my fish is still in his bag.

TITLE:  Over bleached hair! What products should I use!?
BODY: I bleached my hair from a Medium Brown to a Platinum, and my hair feels pretty rough and dry, but it also seems that it's falling out from the root, as opposed to having a lot of breakage!

I've been looking into the L'Oréal Total Repair Extreme for over processed hair, and the Matrix Biolage for over processed hair (both shampoos and conditioners).

Which would you recommend, or would you recommend something different?

What about leave-in conditioners/masques/etc?  Which ones should I buy/Which ones have you had the best experience with? 

Anything inexpensive would be great too. ^__^'

Thanks in advance.  I want my silky smooth hair back..

BODY: Just in case you are wondering why i haven't went to a eye doctor is because i am currently out of town. Anyways about a week or 2 ago i started to see dark spots on my left eye but i can only see when i'm in bright light (sunlight), those weird spots come more visible when im in sunlight and look towards something with a solid color and moving eye around. The dark spots dont look light a black hole or anything like that, it looks more like a cloud shape but it can also look webby . When its daylight i try to use sunglasses most of the time and when its dark i dont see it anymore .  i looked it up and it can possibly be Photostress but i cant find much info about it. also one more thing when i look at fluorescent light and move my eye left to right i can see weird lines vertical, i dont know if thats the same problem or not.  If you can please tell me what it can possibly be it will be a big help and relief some stress off.

BODY: When I'm watching something on TV I usually get interested very much. But now I have no interest. Things I used to ejoy I don't enjoy anymore. Like when a tv show comes on that I used to like I don't focus on the plot. I just blankly stare off into space and get mesmerized by objects in the back ground of the screen. Instead of focusing on the characters I just focus on the scenery and I just have no interest in anything anymore. When ever someone is talking to me I just have no interest. Is this apathy?

QID: YA:20150809152646AAeh10e
TITLE:  JAVA question. Can anyone help? :)?
BODY: Assume employee wage information is stored in three arrays. One array of integers is used to store
employee numbers. Another array of doubles is used to store the corresponding hourly wage of
the employees. Yet another array of doubles is used to store the corresponding number of hours
worked for the employees. You may assume all three arrays are synchronized with one another.
Synchronized means that the information in firstArray[n] corresponds to secondArray[n] and
thirdArray[n]. Gross income (income prior to any deductions) can therefore be made for a particular
employee by multiplying the corresponding hourly wage by hours worked. You are to write a
method that accepts these three arrays as parameters, processes them, and displays the following:
· All employee numbers belonging to employees who have earned more than $1000.00 net
income (income after certain deductions have been made). Deductions are to take place as
follows:
o 10percent of the first $500 of gross income is to be deducted
o 20percent of the next $500 of gross income is to be deducted
o 35percent of the remaining gross income is to be deducted
· The value of the entire net payroll
· The value of all deductions made
You may assume all three arrays are completely full. This will allow you to compute the length of
the array for processing purposes should you find this useful.

TITLE:  Vaginal Discharge: Birth Control Related?
BODY: I had been taking birth control very religiously for about 2-3 years, never missed a day and all that. After my last period, which was sometime last week, I decided to stop taking it. 

Today, I was feeling some uncomfortable pains in my abdomen, and it's been going on and off throughout the day. It wasn't until just now, when I went to the bathroom, that I noticed a glob of discharge. I've never had anything like it before. It's like a clear, brown color, jelly-like consistency, but doesn't seem to have an odor.

Honestly, is it normal? It was like the size of a dime! I haven't had sex for awhile either, so is it just a sort of birth control withdrawal?

TITLE:  MacBook Air touchpad will move but won t click?
BODY: I have a MacBook Air 13" laptop and I got a little bit of water on my keboard towards the bottom/middle right. I was quick to flip it upside down and rub the water off. It was working fine and about 5 hours later the touch pad was able to move, but wouldn t respond when I clicked on things. I tried restarting it, giving it about 25 minutes to rest, and turned it back on. It worked for about 30 seconds and I was able to get onto my account, and then it stopped responding again. I turned it off again and flipped it over and put a fan under it (I read online it may help remove water if there s damage) I ve left it off for about 2 hours and still no response. My laptop is about 2 months old and my parents will kill me if I tell them...is there anyway it s not water damage and if so how can I potentially fix it. Thanks!

It lasted for 10 years. It was largest unemployment rate in American history. It was really bad. Many pictures that were taken during the time are pretty hard to look at. I also know that Europe and Asia was experiencing a similar depression. But did Canada have a hard time during our depression too? If not then what was happening during the time?

BODY: Does wheat/grain based food cause this? I have been thinking about switching to grain-free food in order to perhaps cause less plague buildup in my dog and cats. But I am not sure if grain/what hurts them. 

What mainly causes dental problems in pets?

TITLE:  What comes next after writing a book?
BODY: I spent eight years writing out an outline for saga and the last two years finishing book one as I was occupied with school. I was told among friends that a publisher is an editor themselves as long as they think my idea is good enough? I'm a paranoid person, I have my first book completed and edited thoroughly, unlike my book this question I'm asking is not typed out very well, for that I apologize. You hear millions of people say "My book is number one" or "It's going to be a best seller", lets put everything to side for now and just pretend for one moment, that I wrote a bestselling novel. Where do I go from here?

TITLE:  WiFi Up and Down but LAN 100Mbps?
BODY: I'm having problems where my wifi plummets for periods of time.  I've been speedtesting all the devices while streaming Netflix and one Galaxy Tab (old, Tab 2 I think) causes the wifi to plumet.  If I stream from new tablets or phones it hardly effects the speed.

Is there some meaning to this old device or purely coincidence?

Netgear N300, Xfinity (about 100 Mbps on Lan).

TITLE:  How can i tell the difference between whether my dog is sad or tired?
BODY: are there any distinctions?

i play with my dog for like 1 hour periods, take an hour break in between where we both relax.

my last dog i am guilty about not spending enough time with it and i hate myself for it, so i wont let it happen again.

there are times when my dog is mopey. i'll try to pet him but he'd walk away as if he's annoyed. usually this is after a break. i offer it to play but he just stares at the toy and doesn't do anything.

i can't tell if it is because he thinks i don't really want to play with him, or if he just is tired. The former isn't true, however i could understand why he might think that after we sit around and relax for an hour.

TITLE:  Can someone under 400lbs be cause of an airplane crash?
BODY: I was just wondering if it's possible. If a flight had a few people in that weight range, and then several people under that weight range, would the plane be okay? 

I've read a few things online that say they weigh you.... Where is this? o.O when you put your carry-on stuff in those bins and the have you go under the metal detector? I'm just wondering how they know you weigh what you do. 

I've read that they re-seat people due to weight sometimes... I've never been asked to be moved and I've been over 300lbs in flight before. 

I have to fly in a month. I'll be 7 months pregnant at that point and I can't seem to shake the fear that I'll be a cause of the crash. I'm sure that's really absurd to think but I can't help it. Hoping some pilots or anyone that has experience with this category can give me some answers. :) Thank you in advance. 






((And since I'm sure there's still trolls a-plenty around Y!A, I'll just say "yes, i'm aware this fatass needs to lose some weight. Thanks for any reminders in advance"))

BODY: I have been on this birth control shot for about 5 years. It does have a lot of symptoms and cramps are a common one. However these cramps are like fall to your knees shouting in pain kind. I asked my doctor (OBGYN) about the cramps and his answer seems to be the same as everyone's saying that cramps are a normal side affect. These feel way different than normal cramps, they feel like something's tearing apart my insides. Has anyone experienced this while on the shot? I literally can't move for like an hour.

TITLE:  Ocular Herpes in One Cat: Multiple Cat Household?
BODY: Hi there!

I recently became a foster volunteer for homeless cats. Today I received my first foster cat. As I was reading over her medical records, I noticed that it stated that the scar on her right eye may have been caused by the herpes virus. 

My concern is that I have two of my own cats. I'm worried about them becoming affected by the same thing. Both are up to date on vaccinations if this makes a difference.

Should I be concerned? How can I prevent this without keeping them separated at all times? 

Thank you!

TITLE:  What do you think I should do?
BODY: Last year around this time I was diagnosed with anxiety &amp; depression. I found out my biological mother had it. So anyway lately for some reason I have been having very severe attacks &amp; paranoia out the wazoo. I keep thinking the worst when it probably is nothing. I am trying so hard to get over it by taking my meds, less sugar &amp; caffeine and more veggies things like that. My biggest thing is I feel people are thinking the worst about me but im sure its just in my head. I keep telling myself just be yourself and the right people will love you etc. How do I shake this? I also feel that everyone is getting more ahead than me and I keep telling myself to just keep doing what your doing work wise &amp; don't worry. I feel like I do give a lot of myself but no matter what my whole life Ive never been "popular" and I have struggled with anger issues and a few other addiction (not drugs). I just cant seem to let this go. What is the best thing? thanks in advance :) 
 I have met people to who really have an ego and seem to be very popular but if I show even the slightest bit of one people back away. What should I do? I feel like just giving up no one seems to think I even care when I do

TITLE:  Can I just use body wash towel to ex foliate my body and face ?
BODY: I've searched and only found people using facial mask like products to ex foliate. 
So if ex foliate means to just scrub away dead skins then all I need is about anything to scrub my skin then why buy facial scrubs ? It costs more money and just makes you have more products to buy and use. I know it's more gentle because you don't actually scrub but is it worth it ? 

I usually just use my body wash towel
and apply body wash while kind of scrubbing but not thoroughly. I use my body wash towel everyday I take a shower.
Is this right method of exfoliating ? 
I never did use on my face though.

BODY: Okay, so I got a message off this girl on Facebook asking if she could have my number so she could send me a text and I give her the number from it, I was hesitant so gave her a different number instead. She randomly said "I fixed my phone now thanks anyway" and then her account was gone. Nor my boyfriend or I can search her on Facebook. I'm not sure how long I've had this girl on Facebook but a lot of people followed her so I don't think they made a fake account recently. I'm really worried about this and don't know what she is doing with the number. Help.

TITLE:  I have a suicide question?
BODY: Alright so this is very hard for me and i'm kinda freaking out a little bit. So when summer started i got diagnosed with anxiety and depression and it seems like its only getting worse and i feel trapped. Like theres no way out of this and ill never get better, i know it seems over dramatic but I'm just really kind of done with everything. And that scares me. I don't want to die but it seems like the only way out. Ive been seeing a therapist and i haven't told her i have been having suicidal thoughts yet but i see her tomorrow so i was wondering if you think i should tell her? I don't want to disappoint my parents, but i feel like everyones better off if I'm not here. I already figured out when and how and what I'm going to give away. So basically, do you think i should tell my therapist? Will i get hospitalized? I heard the younger you are the more alarming it is, so im not sure. Im 14 
By the way im sorry for any grammar problems i reread it 5 times and it seems okay but just incase im sorry

TITLE:  How can I burn my body fat? And gain muscle? (Bellyfat+Abs)?
BODY: Hi, Im 5'5 and 100lbs (girl) and I want to burn my body fat mostly around my waist and gain muscle which would be abs. I have read that to decrease body fat , you have to decrease your calorie intake. I eat about 1200-1500 calories per day and I feel like if I create a calorie deficit, it would result to losing weight and an unhealthily choice . I did some HIIT Cardio sessions for 40 min about 4 times this week and after I do my workout, I am very hungry and feel like my body is asking me to eat more food as If I a not eating enough. I am confused on what to do exactly so I can burn my belly fat, overall body fat and gain muscle without feeling hungry and starving myself.. I know to gain muscle, I have to do strength training and certain exercises to target to muscles I want to build. Should I create a calories deficit or should I workout even more? If I am doing cardio, can I just eat the amount of calories I was eating before?  Someone please help me understand what I have to do to achieve my goal.

TITLE:  What kid's book is this?
BODY: I used to check out a book from the library all the time when i was a kid, and I'm trying to remember the title but I can't, and searching the internet hasn't helped me... It was illustrated, it may have been a comic book but maybe not. It was about two boys and they used skateboards. I think the title may have had something similar to "netherlands" in it? There was a vampire in it who didn't drink blood and lived off of red popsicles, and the two boys were doing a project for school about the Alamo, that's about as much as I can remember.

Also, do I need to send a regular 1040 as well. It never said anything about the 1040 apart from when it asked for some figures from a line in the 1040. Is it necessary to fill that out too.

I'm just a student. Haven't worked for the past two years

TITLE:  How to get over being cut from this team?
BODY: So last week I tried out for my old 11u travel time (I am playing 14u this year), I went to tryouts and I gave it my all. I went to the batting cage for an hour beforehand, I hustled everywhere. I didn't hear back for a week, so I thought I made the team. I got home from diner today to find out I was cut. This hit me like a bullet. I was so looking forward to going back, and playing with my friends, and now I have to go try out for other teams. How can I get over this? I am having a tough time. The coach offered me to tryout for the other 14u team, but the main reason I tried out for this team was to be with my friends again.

TITLE:  Crating my dog all day?
BODY: I have a mini schnauzer who is a rescue and has separation anxiety. He cries (more like screams) for hours when I m gone if I leave him out in the apartment. He is totally potty-trained so I don t worry about him making a mess, but he still cries if he s left out. If I put him in his crate and cover it so it s dark, he doesn t cry. The crate is big enough for him to stand up in and turn around and lay comfortably. I m gone about 9 hours a day with work and my commute. Is this too long to crate him? It seems so wrong but he seems happier this way. I live in a dog-friendly apartment complex so he gets plenty of walks and play time when I m home, but I want to keep his noise-making to a minimum.

TITLE:  My period is all clots?
BODY: My body has been kind of weird lately. My period (got it on 7/13/15, on time) last month ended, but my sore breasts that usually go away after my period remained. They got less swollen and full feeling, but the soreness kinda remained. I took a pregnancy test on 8/3 (with first morning urine) and it was negative, so I ruled that out. I got my "period" two days later on thursday night. 4 days earlier than expected, but my periods sometimes come a few days earlier or later than expected so I didn't think much of it. It started out as brown spotting then became heavier with clots. In fact, it was all clots. Usually my periods are so heavy the whole toilet bowl turns red (sorry, tmi), but it was just huge clotting. In fact, there isn't really a "flow" just passing huge clots once every few hours. Last night I bled a BUNCH with large clots but nothing as heavy today. What could be going on?

I've been getting bored with my leg workout and wanted to change it from 2 days of of heavy lifting to 3 days of biking for 30 minutes. But i hear biking makes your legs smaller, and I'm already slim so i dont want my legs to be sticks. Will biking this much make my legs smaller? Is it a good enough leg workout? Not looking to necessarily gain muscle, but especially not to loose.

TITLE:  Have you ever hacked a school computer?
BODY: What did you do exactly? Did you get caught?

When I was in Junior High, our school had iMacs. I booted the computer into Single User Mode, which in other words, means you type in code instead of clicking on icons. I typed in some code that changed the root password to whatever I wanted, then I logged into the root account.

The top right side of the screen read "System Administrator" when I logged in. &gt;:)

I installed some games like Amnesia, but here's what I didn't realize... When I installed those games, they got installed on ALL THE IMACS! All of my old school's iMacs now have Amnesia on them. Still. I talked to someone and they said it's still there.

My teacher suspected something but I talked him out of it. &gt;:) hahahaha

TITLE:  Where to find lingerie for skinny girls with big busts?
BODY: It's extremely frustrating for a girl with breasts over size DD to find bras, but it's doable, but it is seemingly IMPOSSIBLE to find sexy lingerie! Wherever I shop big bust seems to equal plus size, but I'm thin enough to wear size 0 dresses, if it weren't for my breasts. I can make and tailor all my tops and dresses, but lingerie is a bit more difficult. Does anyone know of any places to find cute lingerie for thin girls with cupsize F-G?

TITLE:  Hard drive is corruptive. What happened?
BODY: Was downloading my iTunes to my external hard drive and all of a sudden my computer froze. So I manually shut it down and now it says my hard drive is corrupt. I tried to reconfigure my hard drive with my backup disk but it will not work. Now I'm going to be getting a new computer and I'd like to know what I should install for antivirus malware and spyware. I would like to have it for free I'm tired of paying for it. Thank you in advance

TITLE:  Update an APK through the play store?
BODY: https://www.robinhood.com/

Robinhood is an new company, and they recently started an android beta version. You can only use the app if you are invited, and some people (like me) will be waiting months for it. 

I didn't want to wait for the invite, so I found the APK and downloaded it to my phone. 

The issue I'm having is that after I download the APK, I can't update it.. I go into the play store, and it's not listed under "my apps". How can I update the app?? 

Thank you for any help you can provide!!

I have breast but only because I'm bigger ( I believe) I have no hair on my under arms (on my legs and pubic area because I jumped the gun and shaved it without needing to). I have no b.o. And don't require deodorant to smell fresh. I have no period. I also have a hump on my neck, or as I refer to it as a fat patch. All my fat is centered on my stomach, and a tad is on my inner and upper thighs.

TITLE:  Any estimate on how many pounds I will lose in a month with good cardio exercise and dieting?
BODY: I am 5'4" 16 y/o male, currently 135lb, and I am really cracking down on myself to get rid of an extra 25 or so pounds I have been carrying around with me for the past while.  I have stopped eating breakfast because honestly, I am not that hungry anymore in the morning.  I have also reduced the sizes of my lunches and dinners, and started drinking a lot more water instead of juices and sodas, with a glass of sweet tea every once in a while.
I am starting to work out, and the routine I'm using comes from this video, &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B38ttorbISM&gt; , a 15min cardio workout, that I try to do 2-4 times a day. On top of that, I jog a quarter mile around our property 2 times a day at random times.

Coming from someone who hopefully has used similar techniques to lose weight, how long do you think It will take to drop 25 lbs using my routine and diet so I can be slim again?

TITLE:  I hate where I live so much please help?
BODY: I have lived in a small town (population of 5000) my entire life. I am turning 17 this year and starting my junior year soon an my parents have just started to look for houses in a city with 160,000 people, but they keep saying we need to wait to move. I hate my town. There's nothing to do. All we have are bars and I'm 17 so that's not an option. And everyone here is old and racist or rednecks. All we have is a small movie theater and skatepark for teenagers. And I've gone to both so much that I hate them now. I just want to move and my parents want to wait until I graduate but I told them already I don't like this town. My school has 300 people and everyone is just super nosy and every time I leave my house I know every person I run into. I just hate this town. I have been to the town we might move to and I love it so much. Every time I go there I meet new people and I have friends and family there but I'm stuck here. And I've joined almost every club and activity to keep me busy but it's just so boring and plain all the time and I can't shop anywhere and there's never any new people and I'm so depressed. I just cry almost every night because I just want to move so bad but I'm not in control of where I live. I just don't want to stay here at all. And my parents want me to wait another year, but how the hell am I supposed to stay here when every day I feel like ****? I just can't wait a another long year to get out of this town. How do I deal with this?

TITLE:  Am I okay to wear white pants (ladies only please)?
BODY: Hi, so I have orientation for high school tomorrow. I'm dressing in a classy casual outfit and was planning on wearing white pants. The only issue that I've been on my period for 7+ days and I'm still spotting a little. It seems like whenever I think I've stopped it starts again. Will a pad be visible throw my white pants? Will I have to wear something else?

TITLE:  Spencer's socks?
BODY: So I bought socks from spencers (i'm a girl) but when I wore them it was slightly tighter than I expected and I would assume all of the socks are the same size, i'm fairly skinny but probably my calves are big since I'm in Band camp right now but is there any way to fix this? It's basically socks with a printed design all over it but when it stretches you see the white lines everywhere on my calf area.

TITLE:  Weight remains the same?
BODY: Despite working out 5 times a week I still remain the same weight as I was before 5 weeks ago. I am now ~156 lbs (that went up actually!) its been like this for 5 weeks.
-Running 4 times every week and twice everyday, total of 8 miles ran every week, 2 mile run per day
-Working on muscles, such as weight lifting or doing push ups
-Boxing and kick boxing
I don't know why I still remain the same weight however, is it because of how I eat? Before I started on this new routine I lost 15 pounds, but now I am starting to gain it back. How can I stop remaining the same and lose it?

BODY: So i got stoned today im 17 and i just feel like this: maybe i get paranoid from it because im young and feel im gonna mess up, all my friends are into drinking over weed which i dont drink, i have to spend too much time hiding the smell to enjoy myself and i have no one to smoke with. I feel like if i waited till i was older id be able to meet more people that would be into it and maybe occasionally itd be fun? Maybe i could have a really close stoner friend or relationship with a girl whos into it. Am i right? Im not looking for advice i just wanna know everyones opinion on if its morr at ease later or less at ease.

TITLE:  If I stop using the products that caused my blackheads and bumps will they go away?
BODY: About a month ago I purchased:

Biore combination skin balancing cleanser
St ives apricot scrub
Neutrogena alcohol free toner

But after a few days of using these on my face I started to develop a couple blackheads and clogged pores in the crease of my nose. I stopped using the toner but I kept using the cleanser twice a day, and the scrub once a week. I started breaking out with pimples and tons of blackheads all over my nose, when I've never even had blackheads before! There's also little flesh colored bumps on the sides of my nose and under my eyes that weren't there before. So I went to the store and got the neutrogena blackhead eliminating cleanser/mask and started using that at night a few days ago but my skin was still getting worse so I stopped using the biore cleanser.

Basically, what I'm asking is how the heck do I clear my skin now??? I had pretty nice skin aside from a couple pimples but now I have a rough, bump my nose and cheeks and blackheads everywhere!! I hate it and I want to know, will they go away on their own eventually? If I stop using the products that caused them, will my skin return to how it used to be?

BODY: For dance practice we have to put our hair up into a ponytail. No fly-aways or whispies are acceptable. Since my hair is curly, it is almost impossible to not have any fly-aways. So, I got an elastic headband and I have to pull my ponytail insanely tight. This is making my hair fall out and it is damaging my hair. I'm trying to grow it longer and this ain't helping. Any advice on how to have a ponytail more gentle on my hair?

BODY: I'm supposed to go back to the orthodontist in a month to get braces but I'm supposed to loose my last baby tooth before that. The problem is it isn't even loose! They said if they have to they will pull it. The X-rays show that it's ready to come out and that the permanent tooth will come in very quickly after I loose the tooth. It's not loose at all, should I try to remove it myself or just wait and see if it gets loose naturally or should I just wait and let them pull it?

In my mind I have ideas on certain things, but when I go to the store I have a very hard time picking things out. I have no ideas what colors to do anything. I was thinking hot pink, but I always second guess myself because idk if thats a good color. The walls are nuetral (since its an apartment im not allowed to paint + the bathroom space is very limited). In my mind Im picturing something very relaxing,  im stuck on color schemes. I have ideas like candles, pebbles, selves, and things. I think jade is a nice color, but I know it will be hard to find things that color.Can someone pls help me with a color scheme and ideas because I want to start buying things soon. Thanks:)

TITLE:  Is there any use at all of watching horror shows and movies?
BODY: I'm a teen and we live in an apartment. My brother will watch his favourite horror TV show every night and lately it's been a big cause of anxiety for me because it's just too loud and interesting for me to watch. But this show will cover the death of about five or so victims every show and it causes me anxiety about death. In fact it's even caused me globus hystericus, a really uncomfortable (though harmless) anxiety-caused lump in my throat that's not actually there you just think it is and I even went to the doctor. But I haven't really complained to my parents about this because I think it's helpful, I mean if I get used to horror movies then that's good because I'll never get scared of them. Is it even if possible to get used to the horror in films? Why should I make my parents force him to stop watching this show. I'm so stupid I'm the one who introduced him to this show.

TITLE:  Would you keep reading this book introduction?
BODY: One moment they had been flying, eyes vigilant on the flat ground bellow, and in the next the pen of history began a terrible new chapter. In that instant Queen Emeltha’s dragon was shot dead from under her. With sickening thuds a scorpion’s heavy spear protruding from its neck, and two others from its bleeding side. Narda heard herself scream as her queen and unborn king fell from the empty sky to the tall brush bellow them. 
	Some of the Lore, reacting in time, dove to catch her but only managed to slow her fall. In the attempt two other dragons broke their wings, instantly swallowed by the darkness bellow. A score of dragons and their riders plummeted as the large crossbows beneath them sent spears as tall as men hissing through the air. Even as they plummeted to form a protective barrier around their queen, they were too late. The goblins had been hidden in the high grass and surged straight for the queen even as fire and deadly magic rained down on the beasts from above. Those who had survived the first few moment fought desperately to hold off the constricting hoards of demons.
	Falling from the sky like a shot hawk, Narda felt her dragon’s last breath and her own hear shatter before the impact threw her forward. Slammed into the ground her vision went white, and only instinct pulled her to her feet and drew her sword. Blood in her mouth, and the world swimming from the crash she staggered to her dead dragon’s broken form. She felt her heart seized an...

TITLE:  Looking for an artist to collaborate on a web comic?
BODY: Okay so I just wrote a few chapters of a web comic and blah- blah same old same old. Basically I'm writer and I need to team up with an illustrator/artist to make this web comic possible. The only problem is I can't really draw and I don't really have any friend show can draw either. I know my best bet would to be to do something with somebody I know, but's it's basically impossible for me to do that. 

I don't really know where to start looking for a partner in crime, maybe some type of forum or Tumblr? I'm just looking for an artist (you don't even have to be that good, just draw decently) and who can work online. I know it seems pretty impossible, but it really takes two to tango, I could really use a partner to work with.... But where can I find one?

If you're interested, please feel free to let know, I suppose. Thanks!

(I was thinking for it to be powered by WordPress with Inkblot)

Cheers!

TITLE:  Any estimate on how many pounds I will lose in a month with good cardio exercise and dieting?
BODY: I am 5'4" 16 y/o male, currently 135lb, and I am really cracking down on myself to get rid of an extra 25 or so pounds I have been carrying around with me for the past while. I have stopped eating breakfast because honestly, I am not that hungry anymore in the morning. I have also reduced the sizes of my lunches and dinners, and started drinking a lot more water instead of juices and sodas, with a glass of sweet tea every once in a while. 
I am starting to work out, and the routine I'm using comes from this video, &lt;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B38ttorb... , a 15min cardio workout, that I try to do 2-4 times a day. On top of that, I jog a quarter mile around our property 2 times a day at random times. 

Coming from someone who hopefully has used similar techniques to lose weight, how long do you think It will take to drop 25 lbs using my routine and diet so I can be slim again?

TITLE:  Is it okay to use coated aspirin on a nose piercing?
BODY: I got my nose pierced about a month ago and I developed a red bump which surrounds my entire piercing. I went to a piercer and they told me it was an abscess and told me to use crushed aspirin on it for 3 days and it should be gone. All I have right now is coated aspirin, so would it be okay to use that on my nose?

TITLE:  Insecure about myself, help?
BODY: I'm really insecure about my general appearance, face and body. For a few years, since maybe 9 years old, I've been bullied. I have a long nose (cringe) from my dads side. I also have a cleft chin from him. (Basically an indent on the chin, as it's not smooth). People would call me names and point them out and make fun of them, almost all the time. After a few years of that happening, I now hate my features to a big extent. I'm also very skinny. I'm probably around 98-100 pounds, at 16 years old. I know it's unhealthy, but it's difficult to gain weight. That being said, I've always been bullied for being so thin. Honestly, people always found something to make fun of me for. Whether it was my weight, facial features or body shape. It just upset me a lot. Now I absolutely hate everything about myself. I hate taking photos. I hate going in public. I've started a habit 3 years ago to cover my face with my hoodie sleeve over my hand. It would cover from the bridge of my nose to my entire bottom half of my face. I'm truly tired of constantly hating myself and hiding. Any advice or information on how to alter myself would be appreciated. I've heard of rhinoplasty and wrinkle fillers for cleft chins. But I'd like a general opinion or any information. Also just anything to do with self esteem advice, I'd really appreciate it.

TITLE:  I Fell Off My Horse, Now I'm Being Told She's Not Worth The Money We Paid For Her?
BODY: In my seven years of riding, I've fallen off six times. I used to only ride once a week during lessons, then I started leasing about a year ago. I bought my first horse in June, and have fallen off twice since then. I fell off just the other day, we were going over a ground pole (she sometimes jumps over them) at the trot and I was in half seat. She decided to canter last minute, then jerked to a halt before the pole, and off to the side. I then fell over her should. I wasn't hurt in the accident. However, my friend's mother said that she wasn't worth the money we paid for her and made it sound like we should sell her because I've fallen off twice in the past three months. It made me feel really weird, and I was just wondering if there was any advice or tips about what I should do. Thanks!

TITLE:  A/C not decreasing temperature, thermostat wont decrease?
BODY: I would greatly appreciate any help. I have a couple of issues that I am not sure if I am worrying too much or if there may be a legitimate problem.

I have a 2 story home. First floor is ~1800 square feet with an open area to second floor. Brand new home, brand new a/c, 2 units, 2.5 ton for first floor, thermostat in kitchen next to pantry and garage door. When the temperature is lets say 84, I will put the thermostat down to 79 degrees. The temperature will not go lower than 82. It has been about 7 hours and the a/c is still running. When I change the setting up from the 79 i set it at earlier to 81, the temperature will then go from 82 to 81 within 5 minutes, while it didn't do this for the previous 7 hours. I will then set it back down to 79, and the temperature will jump back up to 82. Also, any type of cooking or moving around in the kitchen will increase the temperature up 1 degree right away.

What is going on? The a/c tech just replaced the thermostat honeywell programmable to see if it was the issue and put more refrigerant he said it was low b/c whoever installed it did not put enough. Is is supposed to take this long to cool this large amount of area 4 degrees? Could this be a leak or something wrong with the wiring or more serious problem?

BODY: The printer works using the USB cable but due to space I'd like to wireless print. I had it connected to WiFi at my previous home but never really used it, just set it up in case space was an issue. At my new home I use the settings to connect through the printer but it just loads forever and says no available WiFi options. I've tried looking through Kodak's site but just get an option for a calibration sheet. I know my home WiFi is in range because I also have the computer set up for WiFi and the printer is beside it. I also tried manually doing it from my computer but no luck.  Any help will be appreciated. Thank you.

TITLE:  Continuous loud burping everyday?
BODY: I have been having continuous, loud and long burps for a few weeks now. At the beginning I just assumed I had loads of gas in me but it didn't die down since and I had to burp very loudly every day. Sometimes the burp wouldn't even come out and then settles back in my throat and it feels very uncomfortable. 

I did some research earlier that some medical conditions had burping and bloating (which I also have) as a symptom. I also noticed that indigestion was part of it. I had a heavy lunch yesterday and the meat simply did not get digested and I had to vomit them out later in the evening because I felt so full &amp; bloated. 

Should I seek medical help or is this normal?

TITLE:  How do I treat watery stool?
BODY: So I came back from a trip to Mexico over a week ago and I came back ill. I had what I came to believe as traveler's diarrhea which had symptoms that included, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting. fever, and etc. I had pretty much all these symptoms and they went away after 3 or 4 days except my stool is still watery and not solid. Could it be possible I have something else or can this be treated really easily without having to go to a doctor? Also for some reason I get extremely exhausted around 10 or 11 o'clock at night which has never happened before.

TITLE:  Rash in the back of the neck, right on hair line. How do you get that and how do you cure it?!??
BODY: Okay so I had a tattoo done in the back of my neck a week ago. As of yesterday a random rash appeared on the back of my neck, right on the hair line. My tattoo is a solid two, maybe three inches away from where the rash is but I m afraid it May be related. It s not my first tattoo, this is my third One, and all three of them are black ink and I didn t have this reaction with the other two tattoos which are way bigger so I highly doubt its that but I know it s a possibility. Also, my wedding is a month away so I ve heard in May ne a stress related rash. It s also hot like crazy here where I am, can that be affecting it all too?  IDK, anyone with any kind of ideas how to get this off and what not Will be greatly appreciated.

I'm 13 and I had my period for over a year now and i don't know what I should do. I mean I know that I could just ask my mom about wearing tampons when going in the water but I'm very shy about talking to my mom about this kind of topic. I really wouldn't mind it but I think it'll be uncomfortable since it's a 7 hour drive and my dad doesn't want to make much stops. if there are anyways please tell me.

TITLE:  Cut on balls?
BODY: Okay, so I shaved my balls on Thursday/Friday and it's now Sunday, but today when I went to the pool I noticed some pain on my balls because of my bathing suit, then I entered the shower and I saw these 4 red marks, and I was like "Oh ****...these bitches need to go" so I got out of the shower and put some antiseptic on which hurt like a bitchhhh. After that, I was going to put neosporin and in the process I realized that they were cuts, kind of like the top layer on those small spots were gone, it just doesn't make sense why I would feel it 1 to 2 days after shaving. Anyways after that I put neosporin and a bandaid and will continue to do so. Hopefully they were just cuts and go away. But any thoughts? On what to be careful or how to properly care for this? The pain from the antiseptic was enough to make me never want to shave them again. 
Thanks!

TITLE:  Do I have a concussion or just another migraine?
BODY: I've had migraines since I was 12 (22 now). Most likely they're caused by a neck injury I got in my sleep back then, the injury has become chronic now. 

I've started boxing recently and I spar whenever I can. The other day (Thursday) I was doing some light sparring and was hit in the head at one point. A few hours later I'm about to go to bed and notice a pain (migraine like). I wake up on and off throughout the night (I have insomnia as well though) and notice the pain is worse and I feel nauseous. I go get a drink and notice I'm quite dizzy and more nauseous and sensitive to light. I've had some nasty migraines in the past that have incapacitated me from the nausea/dizziness/sensitivity and I've thrown up from them at times. But I don't know, it felt a bit different than normal in a way? I'm always sensitive to light when I get migraines. I can't tell whether or not I may have gotten a concussion or if it was just another migraine that was a bit different. I feel a bit of pressure where my head was hurting now, but it's very faint; I'm barely registering it. We really weren't sparring hard at all, is it even possible to get a concussion from light activity like that? Or is it most likely because my head went a little wonky and my neck didn't like it so it seized up and triggered this "migraine"? How long does it take for mild concussions to heal completely? Any ideas/advice/recommendations/opinions here are greatly appreciated, thank you.

But all my other (worse) sunburns are lretty much gone already. The spots got a little bit faded. But are still very noticeable. What could they be?? Anything helps. Thank you.

TITLE:  I saw a beautiful goldfish at petco but I don't want to overstock my goldfish tank, would you buy it or leave it at the store?
BODY: I have a 135 gallon goldfish tank with two comet and one shubunkin goldfish in it. I use two 75 gallon filters, one on each side of the tank, to keep it filtered so it *is* over filtered but not by much. One of the goldfish is 13 inches long and the other two are six inches long. It is planted and I have sand substrate.

Today I went to petco (getting some lights for a ten gallon) and saw a STUNNING comet goldfish there, it was white with deep reddish orange spots and long solid white fins. This fish was maybe four inches long, female, and looked healthy. Should I get her? I want to keep 40 gallons per fish and would prefer to understock since goldfish have a huge bioload. What would you do?

TITLE:  Can I trust polyvore?
BODY: I saw lots of clothes I would like to order from polyvore but I've never purchased from them. Has anyone ordered stuff from there? I don't want to spend lots of money on something that's a scam. I see normal looking clothes from the price $1,260 no joke. And I also see cheap prices like $16 for a nice sweatshirt that should cost about $36 so is the site a scam or is it safe?

TITLE:  Do i have HIV?!?!?
BODY: Hello my name is Gabe, im 17, gay, and about to be a senior in highschool. ive been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and have been stuggling with loneliness for a long time. In all of this ive been hooking up with men, mostly protected sex. Recently i hooked up with a guy that im not sure with and i deeply regret it. i have hooked up with him before and i still have contact with him. he says im only one outside of his boyfriend he has hooked up with. he said he is negative and im having second thoughts about it. 

Ive been stressing about it everyday for about 3 weeks now 

My symptoms include: 
small ulcers after hooking up but went away after a day or two
Muscle aches (probably because im active){Marching band at school)
slight headaches 
muscle twitches
constipation
peeing alot (clear)
pooping alot (not diarrhea) i dont know if its because im drinking protein smoothies alot
really gassy
random itchy parts of my body (no redness or rashes)
hallucinations
tightness in chest (probably due to not taking allergy meds and daily inhaler){allergy season}
getting easily irritated with my mom (i feel bad because i dont know how to express my concern to her)

i dont feel feverish, not vomiting, chronic fatigue, nor genital warts. ive read something about irritable bowel syndrome but thats the best ive come up with. Tell me what you think...... please give some feedback or reasoning of what this could be. if i was unclear about something please ask questions!

TITLE:  Workout/excersize help, 14yo f?
BODY: I'm not one of those skinny girls or one of those over weight girls, I'm more "thick" I guess you'd say. I have a very defined 'line' above my belly button and without it I would look like my chest is flat and not bumpy, it's hard to explain but my stomach looks like it's split in two parts instead of flat. I don't want to be skinny I just want to be flat and I've tried and I just don't know how to get rid of the freaking line. So if anyone, men or women have any idea on any workout or special diet     ( things I shouldnt be eating)I could try to get that line away then it would be very helpful :) thank you and have a good day.

BODY: Hi,

We currently have a 6 year-old male Maltese. He s pretty laid back and does his own thing, and after much consideration we decided to add another furry friend to our family. Tomorrow we re seeing a male and a female German Shepherd. My question is, is it better to have dogs of the opposite sex in the house or is it okay to have the same sex? Also, is a Maltese and a German Shepherd a bad mix to have in a house?

TITLE:  BE CENG. vs BSIT vs B(hons)IT for software engineering. Which one is a better path? In detail⬇?
BODY: Ive just completed my high-school in science stream from Nepal. Now i am entering into college, for Bachelor Degree. I want to become a software engineer and get work/job or internships in companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc in US. But i want to get Bdegree in Nepal and head for the master in US(i have toefel books).
In Nepal there are 3 bachelor institutions. BE computer engineering(Ceng), computer science &amp; IT(Bs. csit) and BIT. 
The most prioritised affiliated course for Nepal's University is firstly BECeng then BCSIT(both of years) but on the other hand the in BIT, is taken as a UK degree course of 3 years(and it's comparatively expensive) 
I want to become involved in software and prog. But Ceng course include unnecessary physics and chemistry in some semesters but by completing this degree I'll get to have Er. In front of my name which is highly prioritised in my country.(but its for comp. Engineer not soft. Engineer). Csit and bit on the other hand only have computer and maths in its course. But in order to get into Ceng and CSIT, you need to come from science stream from high school. However you can come from any educational background in BIT. 

Can you guys give me some advice help me to choose 1 given the specifics and circumstances?

TITLE:  What does it do to my computer/safety if I have more than one anti-virus softwares?
BODY: I apparently have more than one anti-virus installed on my computer, but I don't know which of my programs is an anti-virus... I only purposefully downloaded ONE anti-virus, which I got with my laptop. The other(s) must have already been installed. The problem is that I don't know which is which. There are several programs that sound like maybe they are an anti-virus, but I'm not a tech person, so I have no idea. The one that came with my computer is Webroot, and I had to put the disk in and download it.

Some of the ones that were already installed are called "Avast SecureLine" (it sounds like it might be an anti-virus, but I'm not sure what it is), and then there are three McAfee icons. "McAfee Central", "McAfee Security Scan Plus", and "McAfee Live Safe- Internet Protection". Are any of those listed anti-viruses? And if not, what else might the other anti-virus be installed on a new HP laptop?

Once I figure that out, which one should be uninstalled? Webroot, McAfee, or whatever the heck Avast is (if it is even an anti-virus)? I am lost about this stuff, but I am worried about these programs messing each other up... I don't want to end up with any viruses. Please help me figure this out, and thank you for any help.

TITLE:  Does frequent diarrhea potentially mean I have HIV?
BODY: 5 weeks ago I made a huge mistake and slept with an escort. I was drunk and depressed over recently getting out of a long term relationship. Ever since then I have been worried sick that I've possibly contracted HIV. I used a condom, although I have no idea if it was latex or not and the whole thing was over very quickly. I have been having diarrhea every couple of days for the past two weeks and have gotten severe headaches probably 2-3 times per week for the past 3 or so weeks. No other symptoms have occurred to my recollection. But the symptoms I have been having I've dismissed for poor diet, I eat out daily at fast food places for lunch and dinner due to my work schedule and have done this more often than in the past during the past two months. I also haven't been consuming very much water lately, mainly soda and different juices, or milk. Could these two things contribute to the chronic diarrhea and headaches? Or could they possibly be HIV that I've contracted from an escort? The only other thing I've noticed is a rash on my inner thighs that I am pretty positive is just chaffing due to me being overweight and barely being in the obese range. It gets fairly itchy at times, but after doing some research I've found that its pretty common to get a chaffing rash for overweight people. Chaffing rashes seem to look just like HIV rashes though after a google image search so I don't know what to think!

TITLE:  How Can I Get Rid of Mice Without Harming My Cat?!?!?
BODY: As if I couldn't be anymore stressed out, I come home to the "pleasant" surprise that my father found a mouse on our kitchen countertop. Although I am rather meticulous with my cleaning routine, I sadly live with someone who is a total slob and who leaves food out. He told me he put venom on the countertop but here is my main problem. I have a cat and nothing scares me more than him jumping on the counter and ingesting some venom. Although he doesn't have the habit of getting on tables and counters, I still fear that he could ingest some. Or worse, he takes a bit out of a mouse with venom and he suffers from secondary poisoning. As of right now, he was in the kitchen for about 5-10 minutes without supervision (the venom is hidden in the kitchen) but I am paranoid that he ate some venom. He is in my room right now, cuddled next to me but I am aware that the rat poison takes a while to kick in, so i am keeping a watchful eye and making sure that his behavior is normal and that there is no bleeding or lethargic behavior. How can I get rid of the mice without harming my cat???

TL;DR: Found mice and put poison but I also have a cat. What do I do?

TITLE:  Unable to remove unwated file from my desktop.?
BODY: I own an MSI Dominator with Windows 8.1 currently installed. Windows 10 has been released but I am bidong my time due to some driver issues. Anywho, I was recently cleaning my desktop of unwanted files amd folders when I ran into a stubborn folder that refuses to vacate my desktop. From what I understand, the only way to rid myself of this error is to open the CSM window as administrator. Beyond that, I am stumped as to what to do from there. Any help would be highly appreciated, thanks.

TITLE:  How long should I wait to dye my hair?
BODY: Okay so I m half Indian, half African American . I have pretty long hair, goes to about the middle of my back. VERY VERY VERY thick and strong . I take really good care of my hair, I take vitamins each day and moisturize my hair with coconut oil each day (if that helps any). I dyed a very small section in the back of my hair a brownish/blonde color many months ago . So yesterday (August 9th) I dyed that small section of my hair back to my regular color which is a very dark brown. However in about a week or so , maybe August 17th I was thinking about getting my whole head dyed a light brown, professionally done though. So even though I did not dye my whole head and only literally a small section would August 17th or a few days after be too soon to dye my whole head? (Only reason I m in a rush to dye it again is because I m going away to school again and I know I won t have time to dye it again anytime soon)

BODY: There's a dog across our street, They moved in around the beginning of the year. They have two huskies and they're locked in a cage in the backyard. But the dogs keep crying. They're whining and barking wanting to come out. The owners of the household are teenagers and probably have work and school so I don't want to bother them but is there a way I can get the dogs to stop? Like ask the owner to bring them in. I don't want to call the police or something for Disturbing the Public because that means the dogs would be given a warning, then if they continue they'd be sent away or something. Which I feel is bad. So I there a better way to get them to stop? Should I ask the owners?

TITLE:  Why is my 4 month old kitten always in attack mode?
BODY: I found a calico kitten on the side of the road a couple of month ago, she had gotten thrown around pretty rough by cars passing by and got a bloody nose. She was sweet at first, just curious of everything. But after about a month turned into a pure devil. It seems like she's always in defense mode and attacks ANYTHING in front of her, including people's arms, legs, faces, basically anything she can sink her teeth in. She's only sweet when she's hungry or first wakes up. Other than that, you can't even think about petting her or picking her up unless you want blood drawn. And I don't mean friendly playful kitten fighting, I mean "I hate you and want you dead" kind of fighting with ears pinned back and giving you a state from satan himself. Plus the occasional hissing. Even if you're just trying to pet her. And it seems like spraying her with a water bottle isn't teaching her not to, it's more like she sees it as a game and then tries to attack the water bottle.. Nothing works. Would getting her fixed make her stop trying to murder me and my family or is she just evil? And do you have any advice on what could teach her to knock it off and be more loving? I can't keep her much longer if she doesn't chill out. Thank you for your time.

When I heelflip, I land with my front foot on the board and not my back foot, I landed it a couple of times with my back foot on the tail and I broke my board. (I'm overweight if that helps you answer my question)

When I 50-50 I can get my back truck on the box but not my front truck.

When I boardslide (with wax and going at a decent speed) I stick to it. 

Please help and thank you.

TITLE:  I've recently received piercings in my lip, nose &amp; eyebrow. Will my piercings set off the alarm when I got through TSA security screening?
BODY: I'm unable to take them out not only because I just got them, but my natural fingernails (not acrylic, gel or "press on nails") are very long and I have a little difficulty putting on earrings in all 4 holes I have in each ear (since I was the age of 12 when my mother received the same amount of piercings in each of her ears in 1987). I never set off alarms in any government agency building. I take off/out anything of medal before I go through the detectors and not once have I ever been stopped for additional screening. I've traveled by plane numerous times but I only had a lip piercing at the time of travel. This will be my first traveling to the UK to visit my family and I would hate to remove my piercings to not be able to place them back &amp; walk around with a mark in my face where the piercings once stood! It's very comfortable in their place of "residence".  I would hate for them to be evicted without a 30 day notice!

TITLE:  Scared I got a dry socket!?!!?
BODY: I had my wisdom teeth removed 6 days ago but there always felt like there was food in one of the holes. I accidentally dislodged whatever it was and now it feels like there's now a giant hole where the "food" was covering. It stings a little bit right now and I'm afraid the pain is going to get worse and that it'll turn out to be a dry socket. Do you think it is one? Thanks!!!

TITLE:  Housing small bunny with large bunny?
BODY: I just got an 8 week old holland lop who is very tiny. I introduced him carefully to my 5 month old English lop who is large, about 5 pounds right now. they get along wonderfully however I am very worried about keeping them together. I've heard you can house small with large however this baby freezes when he's scared and I'm afraid the big guy will hurt him by accident. Ive already seen him kind of step on him by accident and the baby doesn't move away. Can they not live together? 😢

TITLE:  I am having violent thoughts?
BODY: hello everyone, i ve been having violent thoughts for a while. i do already see a psychiatrist and therapist for depression, but i always answered no when they asked me if i had thoughts of hurting people because, admittedly, i thought it was normal to want to kill people when you were irritated or mad. 

these thoughts are very vivid and detailed, and range from wanting to smash a bottle over someone s head to stabbing them repeatedly. they aren t scary when i m having them, and i will indulge them rather than try to push them away. i do get really upset sometimes when i m not having them, because i don t want people to think i m a monster. i would never act out on these. i ve cried myself to sleep a couple of nights after i realized it wasn t normal. 

i also have really terrible dreams, like where the ground is full of maggots, or where a giant headless man is try to break into my home.

i know i should tell my psychiatrist, but i don t see him for over a month and trying to move it closer would mean i would have to tell my mom i have these thoughts which i don t want to do at all right now. am i on my way to psychopathy?

TITLE:  Looking for a good tablet/laptop for school and gaming, any ideas internet?
BODY: I need a tablet for school (digital copies of books, notes, etc.) but a laptop would work if it had touchscreen (mainly a pure desire since ive never owned a tablet but im an art major and tablets/stylus are a huge help for a lot of things) but i have an airtight budget as a poor college student. My max is around $900 i was looking at the surface 3/surface pro 2-3 but as my hobby is gaming i was worried i wouldnt get enough out of it for it to even warrant getting a "hybrid" as microsoft put it. So any ideas, as for gaming i honestly play all kinds of games on steam so i have no concrete benchmark currently my biggest wish is for it to be able to run fallout 4 when released but that is probably extremely unrealistic for my budget sadly...

My mom bought me a 40 inch for school and at first I put it in the living room. But then I thought, my roommate has a big tv in her room then why should I have a 19inch in my room when I could have the big one? Would it be selfish to take the big one out of the living room and put it into my room?

The purchase didn t go through, but soon after Google Play crashed, pandora crashed. I kept trying to open it again, but it got to the loading screen and crashed. I tried to Force Stop and clear data, and reboot. It took me to the sign in screen and I signed in, but while loading, it crashed again. So I tried clearing data and rebooting again, to make a new account but it still didn t work. I uninstalled and reinstalled but it didn t work. It keeps saying "Unfortunately, Pandora has stopped" my android is rooted, is there anything I can do in root browser to fix it? I have a jellybean 4.1.2 if that helps. Thanks for the answers :)

TITLE:  SEEKING HELP UNKNOWN ILLNESS!! PLEASE HELP?
BODY: My bf has been suffering with arm pain for the last 4 years. He is currently 22 yrs old &amp; can not lift anything without feeling pain. It all started in the summer after graduation, he had to get the meningitis shot that was required for college. He received his shots at a high school, in a mobile RV. My bf was asked if he wanted to get the hpv shot &amp; other shots that were recommended, he said yes. He does not remember what the shots were called. Months passed &amp; he had severe neck pain to the point he could not move his neck left or right without strain. Next his left arm, then his right arm &amp; next thing you know his whole body is in pain. I encouraged him to go to the doctor when his neck pain started but he refused. 4 years has passed &amp; he's still dealing with this pain. He has lost weight, his muscles, &amp; developed a skin problem. My bf is an African American &amp; has light patches on his face, neck, &amp; chest. His skin isn't drastically lighter but you can tell there's a difference. Which all started after his shots as well. He can not go a day without taking a ibuprofen for pain. He is in so much pain he can't even lift up our baby without being in pain. He has went to the doctor with no results. The doctors tested him, did blood samples, and found nothing. My bf is depressed and nor him and I know what to do at this point. So I'm on here to seek some type of advice, has someone out there been thru this? How did you cope? &amp; that did or can you use or do to improve his health.

BODY: I recently switched from day to night shift (7pm to 7am). Now that I am on nights my stomach has really been bothering me and getting bloated and gassy which causes me to have awful abdominal pains. To alleviate this I took a gas relief tablet (which is not expired and claims no side effects). I only took them once and since then I've had   Diarrhea when I can actually go. I can only go a little then I feel constipated but I get diarrhea again 30 mins later. Idk what's going on so here I am for  insight. Thank you.

BODY: I like wearing dark colors. Even my entire bedroom is black accept the walls to be white. To me it feels very comforting. But as of thing such as a rainy day or aspect of death, feels same as anyone would feel like, fear or sadness. I never really liked bright colors in rooms it would just really annoy. Darker dull colors always comforted and fascinated me more.

TITLE:  How do I help my bone bruise heal fast and stop hurting?
BODY: I was at gymnastics attempting a back handspring and when I jumped back I landed in like a handstand, so it was alot of force and heavy impact on my elbows. I got this sharp pain, when I landed, in my left elbow. 
I went to get it checked out and they said it was a bone bruise, and to stay off it for a week and ice it, so I did.
But when it didn't hurt anymore when I pressed down on it, I went back to tumbling and when I did the back handspring the same thing happened, so I stopped when I realized it wasn't better and iced it for another week... 
Basically this process continued four more times, but my cheerleading season has just started and i don't have time to stay off it for a week.
So I started back at it and I guess I was putting more pressure on my other arm and now they both hurt!! So lately I ice them after I practice and wrap them up when I am active.
Is their anyway to make the pain go away, or anything i can do to help it heal faster?
I spent a rough two months doing my best to stay off it but I don't have time to do that now, I am now doing 7 hours of cheer and gymnastics a week and i can't put it off.

I thing the earrings are starting to make slits. I cleaned them with alcohol and some of the solution Claire's sales. I've had my ears pierced for about a year now so I thought they would be able to handle something alittle heavier. I guess what I'm asking is will I be able to wear earrings at all now? Am I going to have to let them close up now and have to start the process of a new piercing?

TITLE:  When should i start putting some fish in my turtles tank?
BODY: I have a yellow bellied turtle named Flash, as in Flash Gordon, and he is about 1.5". I know there was a law about selling turtles under 4" but for some reason i got this guy. I have just been feeding it some pellets and some cut up freeze dried shrimp, but i was wanting to know around what size could i start putting some small or baby guppys in, since we have a tank full of guppies and they just keep multiplying so i figured a good way to keep their numbers in check was to feed a couple to my turtle. So a general size is what im wanting to know, also how can i tell how old he is? If you want to see his size now just post in the comments

TITLE:  Thought my period ended?
BODY: Okay. Today is the night of August  9th. I started my first period on the 7th. Today I went along with my day and had softball, so when I got home I showered. I put on a new pad then realized when I peed there was no blood and my pad was clean, so I took it off. Then like 2 hours later I went to the bathroom and my underwear was wet but I assumed it was just discharge or something. Then when I looked in the bowl and wiped there was blood so I put on another pad. I don't have much experience at all with anything like this since this is my first time. How can I be sure my period is over?? Tips or advice appreciated.

TITLE:  What's wrong with my back?
BODY: I'm a 16 year old guy and I work making pizzas at a pizza restaurant. It's just standing around making pizzas for around 6 hours. I don't get to sit or lay down or anything. But it's not like constantly standing still. I move around and do various things. And it's not nonstop working. There is periods of being able to rest. But after a while of working, and especially when I'm rolling out dough, my back really starts to hurt. It's pretty bad. When it gets worse, it feels like there is a hole in my back. And sometimes my back even starts to burn. It never hurts when I bend down or anything. And I never crack my back like some people do. I don't know what I could've done to it. I go to the gym often. But my back never hurts when I lift. I also swim competitively but it never hurts during that either. It only hurts when I stand for a while. I take 1000mg of ibuprofen a day for four days. Then I'm off work for the next three days. But the pills rarely work. And sometimes it even feels like it gets worse because of the pills. I know this isn't normal for a guy my age. Especially for a fit guy like me. My parents don't even have problems like this. So if anyone knows anything help would be appreciated. Thanks.

I have all the drivers install most recent. 
The fps drops occur in everygame, note i am not getting low fps. MY fps is 150 or lower all within playable range but then drops to 7 or 10 and then jumps back up. This is not a temp issue for the temp constantly stays below 50C. Any answer is helpful.

TITLE:  Am I playing a wise game here?
BODY: OK, so there's this railroad building game where me and some others are competing to build routes across the western US. I agreed to do a challenge from St. Louis to San Jose, and someone else chose New Orleans to San Diego, and someone else chose Chicago to Oakland, and someone else chose Minneapolis to Seattle. There are four other railroads building from the east to connect to our railroads and compete against each other. 

Well instead of going directly through the mountains and lots of sparse areas and rugged terrain west of Denver, I instead turned from St. Louis to Tulsa and Oklahoma City, and now am turning west to Los Angeles and San Jose.  However, I haven't built as fast on my Pacific route as some of the others, 'cuz I'm also making Kansas City a huge hub and my headquarters, and I'm establishing more huge hubs at Tulsa and Oklahoma City, and some smaller cities on the playing map that the others are overlooking, like Texarkana, Little Rock, Shreveport, etc, so then I can connect to big cities like Houston, Dallas, Austin, etc.  I'm doing that to take over a lot of the west and help feed my western main tracks.

TITLE:  Bad heartburn won't go away?
BODY: hi I'm 19 and last night in the middle of the night I started getting heartburn. It woke me up but I was really exhausted and fell back asleep. when I woke up in the morning the heartburn was still there. I only ate a granola bar because it was bothering me. I had 2 tums and they didn't really help. then I didn't even try eating again until 6 because the heartburn didn't let up all day and I was scared to make it worse. I ate a little and it was alright so I ate a little more a few hours later and the heartburn got really bad and made me feel slightly sick. I took some Pepcid and I didn't notice any change. what should I do and what foods are good to eat??

TITLE:  I think I may have testicular torsion. Help!!?
BODY: I started to have pain right above my right teste after a night of engaging oral sex, in which she sucked on them. It wasn t that bad though it made standing and walking uncomfortable. I figured I knocked on something and pain just took a moment to catch up. The next morning the pain dulled a bit so I explored the situation first visually. I noticed a strange lump right above the right testes and I felt around a bit to confirm it was apart of the works. Its been two days no swelling or discoloration just mild pain when the knot brushes something. I m currently convinced that its a torsion but what I read up on doesn t match. I tested the pinch test to check but no reflex but the scrotum still moves on its own with hot and cold. The right testes doesn t appear higher up than it normally is. I know I most likely don t have a torsion, considering the information I looked up says otherwise, but I am concerned and wish to have an idea of what s going.

TITLE:  What should I do about my cat?
BODY: Okay, well my kitten does NOT like to sleep alone. We made this little comfy bed for him where he has his litterbox and food and water and toys, but he will start crying loud if we leave him in there at night alone and wont sleep. I know this isn't good for him, so Ive been letting him sleep with me.   But this has been proving to be a problem, because he will act like hes asleep, but then when I barely move he will crawl up on my face and start purring really loudly in my ear, and kneading me, and I cant sleep with him doing that. Either that or he will sleep for about an hour and then wake me up by attacking the bed covers. I want him to be able to feel safe when he sleeps,  but I need to be able to sleep as well. What can I do to fix this?

TITLE:  Why some people believe that because of western civilization's recent success they are superior to others?
BODY: Honestly anybody conversant of history would know that other races have had civilizations which were advanced for their time and lasted for thousands of years. If the world had been as global then as it is now those civilizations would have dominated economically and politically as western civilization does today. The world existed long before western civilization started making head way (which was just about 500 years ago) and others were building great societies long before Europeans knew how to do anything. People have to understand that this power dynamic shifts. There was a time when the great civilizations were in Africa and another time in Asia and i wonder what white supremacist would have said if they existed then. The only key significant thing in Western history that set them apart from the rest was just their renaissance, followed by their ventures to discover other places genocide on others,colonization,stealing of resources, industrialization, technological advancement and 2 world wars leading to development of weapons of mass destruction. Western dominance might not last longer because of their rising economic problems, depleting resources, pollution and other regions which are coming up and filling the gap.

TITLE:  PLEASE ANSWER QUICK!?
BODY: HEY! so, im a girl going to 10th grade, and in my district, school starts august 25th. 

before summer started, i told myself i was going to lose weight because i am not completely happy with my body. i am 5 4 and 125-130 pounds. but, over the summer i was a lazy *** and barely excersized and i didnt watch what i ate.

i want to lose ten pounds before school starts, but i dont want to be skiny. i want to gain muscle. so i think its best if i lose weight and consistenly tone up. 

theres about 2 weeks before school starts, and i really need to start losing weight. how can i do this FAST? 

keep in mind, i know that starving yoursekf is unhealthy and i will be eating an adequate amount of food. 
what can i do to lose the weight QUICK??

THANK YOU!!

TITLE:  Government takes almost half of paycheck in taxes?
BODY: being a server, I reported $535 in tips one week. I worked 45 hours. They took $211 out of my paycheck to cover taxes. Is this normal? I understand that taxes are going to be taken out, but taking almost half of my paycheck seems awfully high.

TITLE:  How long after Depo does it usually take the average woman to get pregnant?
BODY: I had got the Depo shot back in May 2014. I was supposed to go back in to get the shot July 2014, but I had decided I wanted to try for a baby.. It took about 5 or 6 months counting from August 2014 for my periods to return to normal.. Since then my periods have been on time.. Every 31 days around the 20th or 21st of each month.. I didn't have a period for the whole month of July, but I had what thought was implantation bleeding (2 drops of brown blood in my underwear)... Soft high and closed cervix, I had cramps but mainly on one side, some backaches, tender breast, constipation, gas, and bloating for most of the month... I took 2 hpt.. Which came out negative.. My period was 13 days late.. My cervix was still high soft and closed ( it felt swollen at times) I had sex the day af started... And throughout my whole period my cervix stayed high and even more mushy than before af started (my cervix never descended to a lower position the whole cycle).I had kinda heavy bleeding the first day then spotting for the next 4 days... Now that my period is over my nipples are still like tingly to the touch and I'm still bloated like I'm 4 or 5 months pregnant and my cervix is still kinda high and soft (like the mid position) Could my period have been breakthrough bleeding or just a change in my cycle... Help plz

TITLE:  Will I be fine?
BODY: I am 15 weigh about 176 and i'm 5'11 so I heard that if you starve, you can lose weight, I also saw it on a TV show called Naked and Afraid that these people lost weight by eating little to nothing, so about 4 days ago I decided to do it, I eat breakfast (about 2 egg) and I skip lunch. I eat a snack for dinner (it doesn't go past 400 calories) and yesterday when it was night I was shaking really bad for some reason...so i got a little scared....is it safe for me to continue like this?

TITLE:  What could be wrong with my Toyota Prius?
BODY: I have a 2005 Toyota Prius with a little over 200,000 miles and I believe that I am having problems with my battery. I think that battery is failing on me. This is due to the fact that the battery on my car fluctuates way too much when driving. I start off on the car with one bar of battery, at the very bottom. As soon as I turn it on the electric motor comes on to compensate for the low charge to charge it. Then the battery gets about 5-6 bars (blue). Then a second later the battery goes down to 1-2 bars. Sometimes the battery is low so much it seems that the cars electric motor has stopped and the car seems to be going by the gas engine alone which is very slow. At most I am getting to 30 mph in about 30-40 seconds. 

Now about two months ago I went into the dealer for a problem with the car now starting sometimes. As well as the speed gauge dashboard not coming on which correspondingly made the trunk not open. At that point I still though it was the battery problem. When the car came out of the dealer they told me that the battery was fine. They told me that the only problems that they could find was that the spark plugs were still the originals and the converter was failing and suggested that I replaced those. The spark plugs where replaced at the dealer and the converter was not yet a problem. The confusion comes in when the dealer states that the battery was good. As of now I am looking to get a manufactured battery but I do want to be sure. PleaseLetMeKnowWhatYouThink,

(i technically was 8 or 9 at the time).  i have been to the dermatologist many times and i have tried proactive, epi duo, clindamycin lotion and many more. i have tried tons of cleansers and moisturizers. i have taken many oral prescriptions for my face. i still am currently but it keeps getting worse. but i will admit there was one time my face cleared up from acne but my redness never went away. my face has gotten so bad lately and i haven't done anything different. it's to a point where i was embarrassed to be in public. i wear makeup but i didn't start to till 7th grade. i clean my face every night and morning and add moisturizer to my face. nothing changes. please help me find a solution! i am so desperate! my face hasn't been clear or my natural skin color for many years! anything will help thank you!!!

TITLE:  13 and pregnant, help?
BODY: Please no giving me lessons or anything, I just need answers. About 5 weeks ago my boyfriend and I had sex. I was on birth control and thought it would work, until I realized that I never took it at the same time every night. I'd take it at 8 pm one night, then 4 a.m the next, or 10 and then 2, etc. I've also only been on it for about 2 months and it's low dosage birth control just to help regulate my period. After we had sex, I missed my period. That was nearly a month ago. For the past week or so, I've had diarrhea and I've been constantly nauseous to the point where i'd wake up at 3 a.m and nearly barf. I have headaches late at night and I have a complete loss for appetite lately, my stomach has been really sore for about 3 days. My lower back hurts sometimes, and I have cramps that feel like period cramps almost everyday and night. I'm vegetarian and thinking of eating meat makes me sick, but ever since all this has been happening I've been CRAVING meat! I'm trying to get a pregnancy test asap, but I haven't been able to. Could I be pregnant or am I just freaking myself out?

BODY: Two or three days ago, I started getting small bumps, 6 of them, on my tattoo, not around it. They were the same color as my skin and they were in a circle. I'm worried because they've puffed up a little. It doesn't look like the same 6 bumps, it looks like a ring almost. There are a few bumps that are 'white' and I just don't know what this is!!! Most of the time it itches and burns like hell. I haven't scratched it, I hasn't spread so far. I got my tattoo maybe a little over a week ago.  It's of my aunt's name(RIP🙌); first tattoo ever. My sister and I got our first tattoos together and they're almost the exact same. She doesn't have this problem. Don't want to ruin my tattoo and I am tired of this thing!! Help me please!

TITLE:  I keep having my period?
BODY: It's kinda abnormal...I just keep having my period. Every 2 weeks, I would have another period, and this time, I hadn't even made it to two weeks yet.

I hadn't even started getting discharge again yet, and I definitely don't think i ovulated yet. Usually when I ovulate, my discharge gets really heavy, and quite runny. When I started, unlike my mother, or my family members (all my relatives have light periods, or very irregular periods, and their periods are like 2-3 months in between so I'm not sure whether or not it's a genetic or hereditary thing), I got regular really quickly. Then after a year of having a period every month (it was normal despite the fact that my period also lasted over a week). 

However I started experiencing problems after that. My periods would get very heavy, to the point that a overnight pad wouldn't even last me 4 hours. I had to keep wearing maxi pads to assure myself (I know normal pads and maxi has no difference, but it did reassure me). 

My periods started getting closer together, until I would get another period again the week after I stopped, or two weeks. I went on a 5 week vacation, started my period when I went, had another one in the middle of those 5 weeks, and then started again at the end of those 5 weeks.

They were fairly heavy and lasted 5-6 days (which means I spent 2 out of 5 weeks having my period, not counting the one I'm on now).

BODY: Have you had much experiences using such sites? Have you ever price checked after you get the hotel name, only to find out that you didn't save money on it, after all? 

My experiences were more positive than good, although I may have only used such sites (priceline, mainly) a total of about 5x. 

Not long ago I stayed at the Mardis Gras hotel in Las Vegas: https://vine.co/v/eMreBDeAHdF if you've heard of it or watched the really short vid, does it seem worth it to you? It was through hotwire. It was said to be 3*, but didn't necessarily seem like it to me.

TITLE:  Teeth slightly wiggling/shifting?
BODY: Some background info: 21, with perio gum disease.   For a few months (2? 3?) I noticed my gums would bleed when I brushed my teeth.  Went to the dentist,  and low and behold, mild to moderate periodontal disease; this occurred because I did not floss. About 2 days before my deep cleaning, my teeth started feeling strange. Gums felt sensitive, and my teeth felt uncomfortable. This was about a week ago,  and I recently had my teeth deep cleaned. 

Problem is, I feel as if my teeth wiggle slightly. The dentist didn't mention anything beyond a deep cleaning... No grafts or surgery required. Does anyone have an idea as to what's going on with my teeth? Could I just be extremely paranoid about losing my teeth? I won't be able to visit a dentist again in for another month or so because of my insurance.

TITLE:  How to end conflict between small dogs and big dogs?
BODY: I've got a 2 year old male Russian spitz. A 4 year old female Kuchi and recently we got another male Kuchi dog about 7 months ago. He's 8 months. Since the past couple of weeks The little dog starts picking a fight with the male Kuchi by growling which ends very badly. The Kuchi pup is very loving and doesn't pick a fight. We've assumed that the little one is trying to prove he's still Alpha but that's kind of hard since he always loses the fight. He's grown hostile and will growl at anything or anyone that goes near him. How do I end the conflict between the two before something really bad happens?

TITLE:  I keep having my period?
BODY: Every two weeks, or every other week, I would keep getting my period. It isn't light, it's actually fairly heavy. During the time span between my periods, I hadn't even ovulated, or at least I don't think I have. I haven't even started getting discharge again yet and suddenly another period starts. I got my period 2 years ago, and started off very regular. I was regular for a whole year and a half...but then things started getting weird.

I would have very heavy periods, and I felt unsafe, even when wearing a overnight pad to school and changing it every 3-5 hours. At first it was only heavy and lasted about 9-10 days (with spotting), but then my periods started to get closer together. They lasted a whole week (and then I would get spotting for a few days afterwords). While I used to get blood clots, I haven't been getting any blood clots now, and if I did, they would be very small, and there would be very few.

I do not have anemia, as blood tests showed I was fine. I do have calcium and magnesium defiency but do not believe they are the reason why. I got prescribed medicine that is suppose to 'help blood clot and keep you from bleeding'. It didn't work for me, but it worked for my cousin and it even spaced her periods out more. The last few days, I did experience rib pain and cramps, which is something I never ever experienced along with my period.

And suddenly when I start my period again, I get sick and have a fever.

BODY: I have searched for years for soemthing that works for my skin, mainly my face. I have tried countless face scrubs and finally found bath and body works oahu coconut sunset pink sand body scrub and fell in love but it's been discontinued!!! It's the first scrub that helped my dry, yet oily skin and didn't make me break out or try to burn the skin off of my face, which would end the worry but it's a painful way to win that battle against my stubborn skin. If anyone has used that scrub and can suggest one like it then I will be very grateful for your help. or any other scrubs. 
P.S. NO AVACADO ANYTHING!!!! Deathly allergic to avacado, can't touch it. Thank you for reading and thanks in advance for any help you may have for this issue.

How long did your markers last if you bought Copic Ciao markers? Do they run out of ink fast or go dull?

TITLE:  Should I be worried about a tick head?
BODY: I was bitten by a tick for my first time over a year ago and when I pulled it out I left its head in my hip and forgot to later remove the head when I could. Now it has a layer of perminet layer of skin over it so it looks like a white pimple on my hip. I got a staph infection 3 weeks after the bite and went on a 2 weeks antibotic treatment, penicillin and sulfide based. Every time I go to my doctor I simply forget to mention it. Should I be worried about lyme's disease and tell my doctor and get the head removed. When I got the staph infection it was not near my tick bite and I never had any symptoms of lyme's disease, such as a bulls eye rash near the bite.

Basically my school is telling me I have to amend a 1040x because my mom filed head of household instead of married but filing separately which is what my dad did. So my question is how long does this process take and what papers do I need to bring from my mom and dad when they take it to a tax preparer, do they have to go together ? Also can I get my moms tax return transcripts by myself to the IRS office cause they won't come through the mail (I tried 3 times already ) if she gave me her ID and Social?thanks

it doesn t need to have LOTS of features but it should be light-weight and powerful enough to serve a web store.
easy API integration is most important, because I still don t have enough knowledge to implement it myself.
thanks ;-)

BODY: I'm 6 feet tall and weigh about 185. I do a workout routine almost everyday that consists of push ups, sit ups, bodyweight and dumbbell exercises. I also get cardio by walking and biking.

This is not difficult to do. It just takes a little bit of effort and a little time.

Resisting the temptation to eat is also easy. I try to eat enough fruits, vegetables, meats, carbs and proteins. I drink alcohol in moderate amounts. This is not difficult in the least.

TITLE:  Mole Removal - What do I do?
BODY: Ok, so since I was 7 I have had a mole on my cheek, and as I grew, so did the mole. It is quite large now. I am 15 now and a few weeks ago I had hives and accidentally scratched my mole and cut it. When I went to my doctor she recommended I get it removed by a plastic surgeon to prevent future issues such as cancerous moles. When I went to the surgeon, she told me they would make a cut around my mole 3x longer than the mole itself, that they would stitch it up (and leave the stitches for a week) and then that I would be left with a hairline scar 3x the size of my mole that would take a year to fully heal. However, the doctor also said that the scar might turn outwards and look worse than my current mole, which is why I am scared. My parents are saying its best because when I start shaving in that area of my face I will constantly cut my mole, but I dont want to end up worse... Its expensive too and I really want the mole gone but also dont want a big scar on my face! Keep in mind the mole is pretty big. What do I do????

TITLE:  Would a countertop dishwasher be a smarter option for us?
BODY: The beginning of 2016 I'll be finishing two-year college and moving into my own place with a roommate. It would just be the two of us, both girls always so busy we regularly forget to eat, so I don't know if we'd actually make use of the dishwasher an apartment would provide. I briefly lived in an apartment before and only used the dishwasher twice, after parties, otherwise I washed by hand.
If we only own four place settings and are trying to penny pinch on bills as much as we can, would the money and counter space be worth getting one even though we'd have a perfectly good unit?
I want to save on the water bill, the amount of water we waste, and the time it would take to wash and dry by hand.

TITLE:  Should my tattoo still be weeping after 5 days?
BODY: Ok, this will probably be long, as a warning.  I got a calf tattoo 2 years ago that took 4 hours. I had a terrible time during the healing process where I struggled to walk, and it scabbed over really bad, and the majority of the ink came out.
So last Wednesday (it is now Monday) I went to a different artist and she touched it up. I was told to keep cling film on for 4 days, changing and cleaning it every 3 hours, which I did. On Friday morning, I woke up and it was burning, I went to clean it and saw little whitish spots. I messaged the artist and she said it was a reaction to my sweat inside the cling film (I did inform her this is exactly what happened last time). She told me to ditch the cling film and clean and moisturise it, and recommend Palmers Cocoa Butter. So I went and got some that was unperfumed. I applied some and about 20 minutes later, my leg was leaking like mad, because the skin was so hot it was just melting the butter off. I was at work at the time and couldn t do anything. When I got home I ran it under cold water and cleaned everything off. 
The next day when I woke up, some parts of my skin were pretty much raw. Some of it has now turned to scabs. Since then, I ve been using Bepanthen on the bits that are raw and scabby, and cocoa butter on the bits that are flaky. Overnight the whole tattoo dries out, but once the bepanthen is on, the scabs tend to go soft and weep a little and don t dry back up. Is this normal? Should I leave them to dry?

TITLE:  Are hotel maids/housekeepers supposed to wear gloves when cleaning (Please read)?
BODY: Hey guys, 
Recently I left a part time job as a house keeper at a well known hotel chain in the UK because I thought their procedures were unsafe and quite frankly they were treating me like sh*t. 
I never went back to work because one morning I woke up incredibly unwell with a stomach bug. Nobody in my family was sick at the time, or my boyfriends family. 
I recalled that it could've been from work. At work we werent supplied with gloves to wear when cleaning toilets and such. I'd clean a toilet and have the water splashing back up onto my hands and we were never trained that we were allowed to take a break to wash our hands or anything. The hygiene seemed very poor. 
One time (On my first day actually!) I had to clean up blood sheets splattered with blood (Just a nose bleed) with my bare hands. 
As far as I am aware this shouldn't have happened, but it's left me wondering if hotel cleaners are indeed meant to wear protective clothing? 
Could you guys offer me any insight? 
Thanks

TITLE:  Will warm upstairs affect cooling downstairs?
BODY: Hi all,

I have a 2 story home, 2 units: one for 2nd floor, 1 for first floor and a thermostat on each floor. My question is what should the maximum difference between the 2 thermostats be set at? Will a higher temperature upstairs affect my ability to cool the downstairs?

For example my upstairs is set at 82 degrees and it is maintained, and downstairs is set at 79 however the temperature wont go below 81 degrees. is there any correlation? 

Thanks so much,

TITLE:  What do you think of the data destruction software ACTIVE@KILLDISK?
BODY: Some viruses are so smart that formatting alone is not enough.
The Website: http://killdisk.com/
A quick Q &amp; A on malware:
Q: I think I have a virus on my computer. Is formatting enough to get rid of all traces of it or is there some way to make sure all data is completely erased from the drive?

A: Formatting alone is not enough. You should back up all data you need saved then use a data destruction program (killdisk is one) to overwrite all sectors on the disk. Then re-install the OS and copy your data back to the drive.

So use sandboxing such as Sandboxie or a deep freeze program. Also you could swithch to Linux. If your targeted drive encrypt so no one puts kiddie porn on your computer.

BODY: I was out in the sun today for about 6 hours swimming, I only drank about 3 cups of water today (am currently drinking more to make up for the other cups I should have drank) 

I have not been able to sleep all night I close my eyes and when im at the point of deep sleep suddenly I get hot and like some twitches in either my foot leg hand or arm and then I wake up bc I get anxious! 

I do have anxiety but I have been able to sleep every other night but tonight I have really not been able too! And I don't think its TOO much anxiety's fault here because I had a quite relaxing day actually I just didn't eat much or drink much... I was also very pale in the face but I've been drinking some electrolyte drinks for a couple minutes and my face looks better not all white now. 

Could it be dehydration?

TITLE:  I want to lose weight. Is that bad?
BODY: I have been skinny all my life. I really started to notice and care in middle school. I would be made fun of because of it, being called skeleton, twig and chicken legs. I would ask my mom back then if there was anything I could do and she would just tell me just to wait and that with time I'll gain weight and regret ever saying this. In high school I would try to wear a dress or shorts and I solemnly got a "oh you look pretty" but rather a lot of "you look TOO skinny". So I just wore t-shirts and jeans. At 18 I've gotten better with accepting myself and have gained confidence. Although this is true, I still would like to gain at least 10 pounds. So I asked my mom if she could drive me to Walmart so I can buy ensure plus to see if it would help me gain some weight. She immediately told me no and gave me the same speech that I should wait and that I'll regret it later. She says she was skinny once too and that I should be thankful, but she was never as thin as me. She can never understand. She was the hot kind of thin and I'm the too skinny kind. Should I just forget trying to gain weight and just keep being unhappy with myself? Am I wrong? I don't want to be overweight, I just want to gain a few pounds. I'm 18 5'7 and 113 pounds.

TITLE:  Sore throat or something more serious?
BODY: For more than a week now my throat has been feeling swollen especially from the left side. Yesterday after brushing my teeth I checked down my throat to see that my soft palate from the left is smaller than the right and my dad checked it out too and said that its a little bit swollen around my tonsils and that that's it. I'm afraid my throat might close up completely and were currently on vacation at some island with no hospitals at all and well be back in town at 13 or 14 of the month. I'm scared it'll close up completely by then. It doesn't feel very sorry but at times it feels worse than others (more swollen or closed) and feels like I wanna couch. Also when I take deep breaths it kinda makes it feel worse. Any suggestions?

TITLE:  Puppy wants water all the time?
BODY: Hi, I'm having an issue with my 2 month old puppy. She's a border collie mix, and we got her from a shelter. She was quite malnurished, you could see and feel every single rib of hers, and she was only 5.3 pounds as apposed to the minimum of 7 shes supposed to be for her breed and size. Now, we've had her for a couple days now (picked her up on Friday from the spay neuter network), and we noticed a couple things. One, she doesnt eat dry food so we give her wet food (mighty dog). Two, her nose is mostly always dry, but she's active, alert, and she is capable of getting excited and playful. There's no vomiting, no bleeding, nothing abnormal. Except for three, she's CRAZY about water. Now, I thought it was dehydration so we gave her water frequently, but she started peeing everywhere. We found that the rule of thumb should be an ounce per pound, and we do that, but she seems to always want water. Its come to the point where she wants to drink water instead of eating her food, its nuts! Now I live in texas, and she gets hot, but no matter how much water we give her, she always wants more. Another thing is that she prefers sleeping over the a/c vent on the floor when its on, or on the cold hardwood floor, period. What's going on? She doesnt look sick, doesnt act sick, the only thing up with her is that she's healing from her spaying surgery.

TITLE:  Sore throat or something more serious?
BODY: For more than a week now I've been feeling my throat swollen and a little bit itchy especially from the left side. Yesterday as I was washing my teeth I saw that my throat looks more closed/swollen from the left than from the right. My dad had it checked out too and said itlooked like it was a bit swollen close to the tonsils. Now its not always sore and swollen sometimes it feels nnormal but other times it feels really bad and closed and freaks me out. Eating usually helps and calms it down and I don't have any problem with eating or swallowing. I'll try and have it checked out but were currently on vacation at some place with no hospitals and well be back in town at 13-14 of the month. what do you think?
Please only serious answers I also suffer from anxiety

TITLE:  Puppy wont stop wanting water?
BODY: We got a puppy from a shelter, she's 2 months old, a border collie mix, and she was malnurished. You could feel all her bones and see her ribs. She was spayed and vaccinated on August 7th. Now, there are a couple things wrong. One, her nose is almost always dry, but she's not showing signs of a fever, vomiting, nothing. She's alert, and hyper, and content. Next, she's crazy about water. She never stops wanting it, and I get it, she's thirsty sometimes, but its getting out of hand. We gave her an ulimited supply of water in her bowl, and of course, she started peeing everywhere. So after some research, we started giving her an ounce per pound, she weighs 5.3 pounds so far. However she's always thirsty, she runs toward running water, lifts up her head at any sight of water, and its come to the point where she prefers water over her wet food! We seriously dont know what to do, mom says she cant be dehydrated if she's peeing, so we dont know whats happening! Help?

Is it common for girls in SK not to call a close older male friend oppa &amp; by their name instead? And she called Kim Jong Kook "hyungnim" before i know it means respected older brother but i thought only a male can say it to a male. Please explain.

Monitor or television?, I am currently running a 10 year old Phillips plasma but it get in the way of my family's tv watching, so I am looking for a new display. Defiantly something that plays PS4 at full resoultion. I am leaning toward a monitor right now because they are cheaper, but I hear some dont have sound at all or crap sound. So if its a monitor, defiantly something with decent sound and decent specs. So just give me some recommendations on what I should get, keep in mind this is strictly for ps4 gaming and this is for my bedroom and using this at a desk ( just like I would with a computer)

I would of course clearly state the damage. I've seen broken screens sell, but never the screen by itself. Can other parts from it still be used by someone?

TITLE:  Can my boyfriend and I have an herpe outbreak at the same time ?
BODY: 5 days ago my boyfriend and I had unprotected sex, when he cam inside of my it immediately burned and I had to rush and jump in the bath. The next day my vagina was itching a little but I didn t think anything of it. 3 days later I have red sores/blisters all over my vagina. I went to the doctors and although the test results are not back they are pretty positive I have genital herpes and am now on medication for it. My boyfriend had a red "scratch" on the bottom of his shaft the night we had sex. Today he has 3 blisters on the top of his shaft but he says they don t itch or bother him at all, he also now has a mouth full of canker sores. He has not been tested yet. Is it possible for us to have an outbreak at the same time ? Why is his not as severe as mine? Is it possible that this is not his first outbreak? Weve been together 8 months and this has never happened before.

TITLE:  Matching foundation to my skin tone???
BODY: I've never been into makeup but I'm deciding to now.. I heard if your veins are green, you have a warm skin tone, and if your veins are blue, you're a cool, and if you can't tell, it's neutral. I have an olive-type skin tone with yellow tint, not pink but my veins do look blue. Is the "setting powder" supposed to be lighter than the foundation? Can you list off a few shades that would be good for my skin tone and what setting powder shade?  (an example would be ivory or something). I don't have access to a big store like sephora or ulta to help me.. I just have Walgreens and also dint know what to set concealer with.. Can someone help me out here? I'm super confused and don't know what I'm doing! Haha.

TITLE:  I dont know if i should go to practice?
BODY: Please help me decide, in a couple of hours I got football practice from 9-12. The problem is that Saturday I had got my wisdom teeth removed the 2 bottom ones, and I don't know if I should attend practice today or not. My friend said they already issued jersey numbers and I ain't got mine yet and Saturday was the first day of hitting but I dint attend. Right now I feel fine it's just the swelling I'm dealing with, which I got a heated pad over my face too bring it down. My face doesn't hurt too bad or anything it's just like a little puff I guess. Do you think I should attend practice today if I do there will be contact involved and running etc but idk. The last thing I want is a dry socket or my mouth to start bleeding again. What should i do? Today is also the scrimmage which I can't go too because I dint get my hitting days in. I was gonna go ahead and go but idk if I should once again I'm just dealing with swelling and it's like only a puff. I know it depends on how I feel but I still don't know if I'm making a good decision like I said I don't want nothing else bad too happen.

TITLE:  My guinea pig ate plastic.. HELP!?
BODY: My guinea pig, Percy, was running about on my bed and I heard him chewing on something, when I looked, it was the pack of biscuits I'd left out. He tore off a section of the plastic packaging and I wasn't able to get it out of his mouth fast enough, will he be okay?
The piece of plastic was around 3cm long.

I'm scared it'll get stuck in his tummy. Can anyone help, I need advice on what to do.

TITLE:  Aggressive puppy???????
BODY: I have a 14 week old Lhasa Apso and have had her since she was 8 weeks 
she has always bitten and nipped but all puppies do, she has been doing really well in not doing it nearly as much as she used to.
How ever when she gets mad or agitated first thing she resolves to is biting for example she has just bitten my neck while we were playing with a few tennis balls and it has broke the skin and bled a tiny bit
She's only a puppy so its not a bad bite but I don't want her displaying this behaviour ever again especially when she's an adult.
When she did I yelled out because it hurt and pushed her away and then screamed no at her I know I shouldn't have yelled but it hurt. I then just completely ignored her and played with my other dog. 
I do believe she knows she did wrong as she did look a bit upset but that may have just been because I yelled.
How can I teach her not to be aggressive?? She is a really smart dog and we all love her and just want to get rid of this small amount of aggression. 
Any advice??

BODY: it would cost me a fortune to buy the internet to download an installer, so i want to try and use the swm files instead. they are in the recovery partition.

the main partition is broken, though everything is recovered, i dont know how to make it boot, so, im best off just reinstalling everything on a working windows installation, plus its better i do this after upgrading to windows 10.

the way my system is i cant use this windows 10 dvd i have unless windows 8 is installed.
its a special complementary dvd from an IT store.

anyway, how do i use this recovery partition? 

it contains a folder called rica tools but i cant find anything about it, other than people saying its easier to just download the iso and start over, but they do say its possible.

TITLE:  I am and 25 and my bf dad laughed at me last night. I just wanted to cry. My questions are below?
BODY: My bf and his father were feeding the dog at the kitchen table. I wanted to feed the dog, so I tried calling it out in a wimpy voice, I beleive its rude to scream across the room, let alone feed the dog at the table so I felt awkward doing so. As I tried calling the dog , my bf dad laughed at me, and mocked how I called the dog. My bf wasn't laughing, neither was I. I have a mental disorder called BPD , stuck with that illness is depression and anxiety that my bfs father is well aware of. I also live here for the past year, but latley I feel more stupid than anything. I told my bf if I leave and pay rent , will he follow and sleep with me and he said yes ! We wanted to save for a house, I have this illness from "adults" being mean when I was kid, I feel his dad is changing for the worse. So my question is that should I talk to his dad about it? How do I say it? I feel like he hates this BPD , I act like a kid sometimes .. Mayb I should leave ? It's like telling a depressed person don't be sad. I'm stuck I love my bf, but I don't like his father treating me bad

BODY: Every time I do a drug I get the same feeling.. it is the feeling that something is terribly wrong but I can t quite put my finger on it. I have depression and I am schizoid, could that explain it? I always feel very sad and hopeless and think about the negativity on earth because I believe they outweigh the positivity, and death is inevitable. Should I avoid drugs entirely? I also get the feeling that I can not function in society, and get a dreaded and uncomfortable feeling. I do positive things though, and listen to beautiful music, but they seem like distractions (I usually love music sober though!) and I have to turn it off or I get annoyed.. why??

TITLE:  How to cover up ombre hair?
BODY: The other week I went to get lots of warm highlights put in my dark brown hair, but I ended up walking out with orange ombre.
Since then I have used a medium ash blonde hair dye to neutralise it a little which kind of took some of the orange brassiness away.
What drugstore hairdye can I use to cover up the ombre completely, without it peeking through or going GREEN, which is my biggest worry. Should the dye be more ash or warm?
Thank you!

TITLE:  Flute/Recorder?! (Is there any anime music sheets for any of those instruments?)?
BODY: I play the piano and clarinet (I have a music teacher to teach me), but I always wanted to play the flute. Money honestly isn't a problem, but I am afraid that I won't be able to keep up with my schoolwork and instruments if I start playing the flute (knowing myself). So I was wondering if I could buy a cheap recorder and teach myself. What do you guys think? Is it best to get a flute or recorder? BTW if I did get a recorder, I would only play anime songs and openings; which lead to my next question. Where can I find anime music sheets for recorder? Is there a lot of anime music sheets for recorders out there? Does recorder and flute produce that same melody if they both were played from the same music sheet? So like if I had a "Marry Had a Little Lamb" music sheet for flute, but instead played it on a recorder, would it still be the same song? Thx

I don't really play sports at all, I just decided that I like these socks and I want to buy them. So I did, but only to find out I had bought golf socks. I can't return them, since the packaging has been opened now. What should I do? I don't know if I should wear them at all, because I never know if there will be some magical shoe and sock expert at school or in public and think I'm trying to be cool or I'm very stupid and should not be wearing them...help!!

BODY: So  I had blonde hair for a while then had a Kylie Jenner phase and decided to do a green turquoise color after that faded out I went to the salon to remove the green however I still have green after they bleached washed and glossed my hair (toned I think). I do not live close to my salon to be going back and forth to try and fix it and I don t have all the money in the world to spend. So I have decided to do it myself 😊 wish me luck! My concern is how do I remove the green should I bleach it...or use color fix? I was watching guytang on YouTube and he took off permanent hair dye with a clear permanent and I have been looking and I can only seem to find a pavana clear permanent for people who have a license to do hair 😩 so I m screwed right? any recommendations? Am I stuck with bleach?!?

TITLE:  Weird gnawing (?) stomach pain.?
BODY: I recently caught a cold from my little sister and it s day two into my cold and my throat has been hurting like it normally does but this time my stomach started to feel weird. 
Kinda like I have to throw up but it s not like it normally feels when I have To throw up. I don t think it s the flu because like I said I know I fought it from my sister and she didn t have the same stomach problem.
 Not really sure how to describe how it feels.. For some reason te word gnawing comes to mind but ordering really hurt like sharp pains, but a dull feeling like something thick is trying r I come up my throat. I m also getting very drolly like a dog about to vomit. 
It usually goes away after a while when I lay on my back and have my head propped up, but it returns as soon as I lay on my side. I tried drinking some lemon honey tea and that seamed to have helped a little but the pain returned just nowzi really want to get some sleep because I have to do a lot tomorrow but this stomach issue is keeping me awake.

TITLE:  Pregnant on birth control?
BODY: I've been taking cerazette the contraceptive pill for about 3 months now and have been sexually active. I am stopping taking it next week because I dont want to use it anymore and I dont like the way it makes me feel.

Over the past couple of days I've felt like I could be pregnant, very tired, headaches, needing to pee often, increased appetite, abdomen pain. I am on holiday right now so I cant do a pregnancy test yet.

Could I be pregnant even though I have been on the pill for these 3 months?

I'm stopping the pill in 4 days, if I get the bleed after that does it mean I'm not pregnant or should I do a test anyway in 2  weeks when I'm back to be sure?

Usually it would automatically start the update as soon as a new update was available but now i have to go into setting and start it myself.  After i press check for updates in the settings it takes a little over an hour to download the new update then when my phone restarts to install the update it turns back on with no changes and i get a notification saying "update was unavailable try again at another time". I have a friend with the exaxt same phone as me and his updated a couple months ago and mine still never did.

TITLE:  How to program a repricer for dropshipping?
BODY: I have a small dropshipping business. Whenever my customers place an order on my website, I place an order on another website and get them to ship the orders to my customers. These websites include Walmart, Amazon, main websites of brands, etc.

Currently I am managing the inventory on my website by checking on the sites that I will purchase from.

Can someone enlighten me how do I go about scraping prices and inventory (I just need to know if an item is out of stock instead of knowing how many units are available) of these other sites? I know nothing about programming at the moment. Thus I would like to know which programming language I would need to learn, etc...

Thanks in advance for your guidance.

TITLE:  Is it a good nutrition for a 15 years old girl?
BODY: So,i eat a lot of fruit each day (only apples,nectarines and grapes). I eat about 4 apples a day and the same amount goes for nectarines,and i don't know how much of grapes.. I have three breakfasts: an egg white with a turkey slice and ten almonds for the days i workout; some whole-wheat cereals with fat-free milk (which i don't even drink); three whole-wheat cookies with a fat-free greek yoghurt. For lunch i sometimes have a chicken thigh or salad with tunna. For dinner i have the same. I don't eat bread. I eat fruit throughout the day,and in the morning i do a 30 minutes cardio to burn up the sugars from the fruits. In the afternoon  i dance for about an hour. Three times a week (even more) i work my abs. Am i eating healthy? Or i will gain fat in the stomach area? I do not want to,actually. But i noticed that i have more muscles and my tummy is more toned,since when i started eating more fruit. What do you think i should do? Should i cut down the sugars or i can keep eating as much fruit as i want?

TITLE:  Do I have an anxiety disorder?
BODY: I ve stayed up for 36 hours now and I can t sleep. I have sweaty palms and feet and a horrible jittery, sinking feeling in my stomach. My heart is beating really fast and my breathing is pretty shallow.

I cannot even focus on my work, which stresses me out even more.

Usually I m okay. I can function normally, easily (kinda?) deal with stress by pushing whatever is stressing me to the back of my mind where it builds up. But every few weeks or so, I ll be hit by a day like this, where I can t sleep, can t eat, and can t function.

I often have a stomachache due to stress and trembling hands.

Not sure where I ll go and what I ll do since I do not know anyone else with a possible mental disorder who can refer me somewhere.

I did go through a period where I believe I was depressed or suicidal, but now I just don t mind too much. I have the standard self esteem issues of not feeling intelligent enough or hardworking enough and all that, though.

But yeah. I know the internet can t exactly give me a diagnoses through the screen, but I was wondering if I needed professional help or if I should just stick through this. It s only a few days that happen at varying frequencies (multiple times a week to once a month).

Thanks for the help!

TITLE:  Your favorite Youtuber?
BODY: If you think you're above YouTube and you're just too good for that sh*t, don't waste your time by replying. For those of you who DO like Youtube, who's your favorite and why?

I like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Rhett and Link, and Matthew Santoro.

Pewds because, despite the popular belief that his "simple" sense of humor is "cancerous", I find it genuine and hilarious. Love his videos.

Mark for pretty much the same reason as Pewds. 

Rhett and Link because they are hilarious and really original, and their friendship dynamic is awesome! They remind me of Mordecai and Rigby lol.

Matthew Santoro because of his childishness. He's the perfect ratio of adult and mature, yet childish and bright! He's awesome; I love his rants.

Diagnosed with EDS, POTS,RAS
Which specialist should I see about stomach related issues as each disorder is related to them?
BODY: I'm under the care of the neurology team, cardiology, rhumatology and the spine/pain clinic, I understand the stomach issues can relate to both eds and pots, I have a lot to speak about in each appointment and want to ensure I speak to the right person who can help/refer me as I'm suffering from malabsorbtion vitamin deficiency, my stomach doesn't digest food and my metabolism is either really fast or slow I usually lose weight very quickly I have to eat a high calorie diet to stay the same weight.

Thankyou :)

TITLE:  Why do I care for such odd reasons?
BODY: I am quite shy.. not sure about anxiety.. I just feel uncomfortable outside of school, bcuz it's weird, but I believe tht when in school, I know what I am, a student.. so I do what I do.. in public, I don't know what I am.. a photogenic person, an ugly person... I don't know.. so maybe I'm not really crying because of anxiety.. I cry sometimes when I hear laughter of my siblings and I just feels a pit of sorrow.. I guess you can say I'm kind of excluded from the world... I'm an odd person, really.. not those weird ones who everyone claims to be.. you know, weird.. like, weird.. My prespective of the world is so different.. my imagination is over active and my views differ from what most of my family and friends have.. I only have very few people who actually excepts me and would leave my imperfections aside..  Just thinking about it makes me tear up.. I'm overly sensitive with things like this, yet I'm emotionally numb.. I remember how when I hear something shocking or something I don't want to ever hear, my brain goes dead and I can't feel it... I remember mumbling "I can't feel it " to myself when I heard a close relative passed away while helplessly trying to process the tears coming out... it frustrates me.. but I believe I have a completely perfect and happy life..  I might not be very pretty, and I'm pretty much the definition of unattractive.. I don't mind my looks all too much too often.. it's really weird, huh? I don't get myself either.I'm 15, tho.. could it be tht?

TITLE:  Am I developing an eating disorder?
BODY: I'm 14, 5'3", and 105-110 lbs. mainly all of weight is muscle because I am very active with cheer, running, and tumbling. I have noticed that recently I have been worried about my weight. I have restricted what I eat and mainly only eat yogurt, fruits, vegetables, sometimes bread, and sometimes peanut butter. I eat around 1000-1300 calories a day. I constantly think about what I am going to eat next. I don't really eat snacks, but if I get hungry at night before I go to bed, I'll eat some pretzels, but I always feel guilty about doing so and wish I could just not eat them at all.  I weigh myseleveryday and if I weigh more than I did the day before, I'll eat less the next day. I have started running a lot more because I am unhappy of how my thighs look. When I look in the mirror I always try to make them look smaller because they are so muscular. I run 3-9 miles everyday and if I don't run, I feel lazy. I really would like to lose 5-10 pounds because I am a flyer when I cheer and I feel like I am really heavy to my bases. When I go to practices I always look at the other girls thighs and wish mine could look like there's, there's are really little but hardly have any muscle on them. I never used to feel guilty about eating and my parents have noticed I've started eating less and are worried. If my mom makes dinner, I might have fruit instead, but my mom will try to get me to eat whatever she's prepared, I'll put it on my plate and eat it, but feel very guilty about it later.

TITLE:  Why do I fall asleep with my eyes open?
BODY: Or, at least, I think that's what it's called. 
 Just when you're sitting there and you go into a blank, spaced-out gaze and you don't want to move. It happens to me and passes in just a moment. I'm not worried about my health, but I'm just curious as to why it happens. And I've tried googling it but all I found were like, sleeping with your eyes open all night disorder and such :/

   Thanks in advance, too!

TITLE:  Trying to understand a wireless bridge?
BODY: I feel like I understand what a wireless bridge is, but I am wondering if it will really help me. I have my PS4 in my room where I currently receive about 75 percent signal strength, and I really need 100. If I was to buy a wireless bridge, place it in my room and connect it to my PS4 via ethernet, will it solve my problems. My other question is, if I did this, would it be considered a wired connection or still a wireless connection on my PS4 settings. Any products with links would be appreciated. Keep in mind I am unable to move my current router, PS4, and am unable to create a wired connection. Thank you.

BODY: I am a night owl, I usually go to sleep between 5am and 7 am. I get up around 4pm - 6pm

I have notice that I have gained weight, to be precise more on my *** and around my tummy

Now, I have tested it with close to a month of regular sleeping, meaning from 11pm to 8-9 am and then I seem to lose all that weight

So could this be the reason? Nothing changes but only when I go to sleep

TITLE:  Should I go to ER?
BODY: This past weekend I have been having hot flashes and night sweats and nausea. I am 23 years old. Today I started taking my temp regularly, I woke up this morning and turned my fan off(I can't sleep without the noise) and immediately started sweating and feeling really hot, took my temp and it was 96.5(my normal is around 98.6) I had this hot flash for about an hour and a half. An hour after waking up my temp was 96.3 and is now 96.8 and has been pretty close to that for the last almost 3 hours. This mixed with nausea I wasn't sure if I should go to the ER asap or if it could wait till I have time to get into the doctor. Any help anyone can give me is much appreciated.

TITLE:  No longer get the urge to pee just get bloated what can cause this?
BODY: I never get any warnings or urges to pee anymore. Nothing that tells you oh hey BTW you need to pee. I just randomly become super bloated where my stomach quadruples in size. When I use the bathroom it deflates. Luckily I still have control where I'm not peeing my pants but it worries me. I never heard of this issue normally it's the other way around. What is from?

Ps. I'm 21 with no kids if that helps

TITLE:  I m 16 and need money but I can t work.?
BODY: I m 16 and I can t work like the title says. A lot of you are going to say "Stop being lazy, get off your bum and mow lawns!" The problem is I have three Incurable conditions, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Scoliosis and Ankylosing Spondylitis. These conditions combined are very painful and they have not yet found a treatment that works for me. It is very painful throughout the day and most nights I don t sleep and It has gotten to the point where I have missed a lot of school. 

I need the money so I can do a few things, first getting my license second a car and third would be a computer and my own internet so I can maybe start a career online so I can have my own income and start to support myself. So i m mainly looking for ideas on how I can earn money.

          Send message to email saying "Welcome name and thank you for commenting"

Thats it,  and also for opening accounts
START
          Input received:name, email,password
          Add name and email to database
         Send message to email saying " Thank you for signing up here is your password:password"
         (At this point the user now attempts to sign in using the name and the password.
         Input received is :name, password 
         Search for name in data base 
         If name exists in database then
         Compare password enteted with pass word in the database 
         ESE Print"Incorrect name"
         If password entered== password in database Then
         Allow user to access special features (like being able to comment on the site, chatting with people, reading a book)
        Else  Print"The password entered is incorrect please try again"
        End if
        End if
         STOP

Thats all!
I can then convert the batch file to exe to see whether it can work.
If it is not possible to do with batch code then,  you can suggest how it would look like in java, or  javascript or c++

TITLE:  Was this a blister next to my nail?
BODY: So this happened like 3 years ago and now it happened again (on the same side). I know this cause I asked a yahoo question about it back then too. 
So like 2 days ago I took off my sock to see dried yellow puss and stuff around the right base of my toenail. So I cleaned it up a bit and disinfected it and forgot about it.
Yesterday I cleaned it up again and disinfected it again. Today I messed with it (I know I shouldn't have)
I decided to clean away everything. There was this reddish white puss looking thing and I didn't know if that was it infected so I cleaned it away. I bled a lot and quickly, but it stopped when I put pressure on it for a min or 2. 
But when I looked at it it looks like there is no more skin connecting my toe to my foot on that side and I could like see under the skin *shivers*. There weird thing was that none of this hurt at all. Like I never felt a thing. 
So is this a blister or what? Also why does this keep coming back. I thought it was nail polish the first time (it kills my nails ever time), but I haven't worn nail polish in like a year. There are no other problems with the nail. It looks healthy otherwise.

BODY: My husband was in a car accident with the vehicle stated above and the front left side and rear left side both were smashed in as well as the rear passenger door, but NONE of the airbags deployed. 

I was reading into the GM Recalls but I didn't see any LeSabre's listed... 

Can someone guide me in the right direction on what I can do about this? Step-by-step if possible?

It's very concerning that they didn't deploy, he could have been seriously hurt.

It is a 2004 but we bought it from the dealership, used, in October 2011.

TITLE:  How can I lose weight effectively and quickly?
BODY: I m a 15 year old girl, nearly 16. I m around 5ft5 and I m 65 kg ( around 148 lbs). I ve been under a lot of stress lately due to personal reasons, so I used to snack a lot and eat a lot. Now, I ve realised that I ve gained a lot of weight. I ve moved up two dress sizes, almost three now, in the space of 2 years. Even my parents have started to notice I ve gained weight. I d like to lose weight before other people notice too. I can t go on a special sort of diet because my parents expect me to eat with my family every day , so I wouldn t be able to make my own meals or go on any special diet. I am not motivated to exercise and with my GCSES coming up, I fear that I won t be able to lose the weight in time and I ll just gain more. Any exercise tips or health related tips would be helpful, or any habits I should refrain from doing/ I should start doing would also be helpful. Thank you!

However, I don't have enough money to buy a new pair of blades yet, so if the boots are the same size, could I use the blade from my old boots (the blade that comes with Jackson classiques) with these new boots. Or would you suggest just waiting until I could buy the blades aswell?

TITLE:  Is it bad if I dont masturbate?
BODY: Okay so I am "ASEXUAL" meaning I am not attracted to anyone. So there is no reason for me to masturbate. I remember when I was 10 yr old I tried to masturbate because alot of my classmate doing it (yes, I hit puberty at age 10) and I ejaculated, all I can remember is I really dont like it and swear to not do it again
Everytime I saw or think about penis, vagina etc I feel really nasty and gross so whenever I ejaulate I feel so wrong and gross. 
So my question is, is it bad to not masturbate? Any side effects?  Btw I am 14 yr old boy so it is 4 years since I masturbate.  And oh, I live in uk.

TITLE:  Can I release my comet goldfish?
BODY: We have a small pond in our backyard and There are no other fish that live there except for a few minnows or some other type of small fish. I know there are a few turtles that live there, but I don't want to release my goldfish until they are bigger, so I don't think the turtles would mess with them. This pond is in my backyard and there is no way the water can get into any public water. As of right now, my tank is a suitable size for my goldfish; however, I'm aware that goldfish get big and they get big fast. Everywhere I've read says they do better in ponds and I just want the best for my fish. If you think they would do better in a tank, I can easily just buy a bigger tank when I need to. I just want to know the best option.

TITLE:  What kind of disorder may this person be suffering from?
BODY: I know someone who I feel has some antisocial tendencies. For example, one minute they'll act like they really like you or that you're a friend, and the next minute they completely switch up. You won't hear for them for weeks on end or they'll be really rude. Then next time you see them, it's like nothing ever happened. They also tend to talk a lot of crap about people, only to be cool with them a week later. They constantly change their future goals and get very aggressive when under the influence. They have also admit to me that they didn't hate someone they claimed to hate but they said that the person could continue to think that they hated them. I'm trying to figure out what the problem could be, but I'm stumped. BPD, maybe? Antisocial personality disorder? Can anyone help?

TITLE:  HAs anyone had a near death experience?
BODY: I had one, on a sunny summer day... Me and my friend was hiking... Our destination was only one way entrance and exit. 2 mountains; the first one is taller, takes 30 mins to get up and the second one is connected to a small beach. We ran out of water by the time we reach the beach, and decided to go back. We still have to climb up to get down the one way exit. Just halfway up and we were feeling thursty. We were losing energy fast, both of us got the sensation of fainting. The mountain isn't a designated hike spot but it is close to the suburbs. When we reach the peak, it was getting worse. My friend told me to keep on moving. Fortunately, we ran over a hiker who was willing to give us a full bottle of cold water. Even after hydrating a bit, we still feel fatigue. 1 and a half hour since then, we reached McDonalds. We refreshed ourselves with a meal, coke and a cup of water. 

Heres the bottom-line: the dehydration brought us to the point of collapse. And if we did faint, the chance of surviving is low as i said, this hiking trail is not official, so people rarely hike here. IF we faint, no one will come rescue us and we could have been dead. We were lucky to pass by a hiker.

We did learn a lesson after all.

TITLE:  I'm happy but I don't know much about myself or anything really?
BODY: I'm a happy person but if you asked me to describe myself I wouldn't be able to answer and that makes me sad.
I know I like football and support arsenal and can name players and can give my opinion on other teams. However if you ask me anything outside the world of sport I'm like ehhh. Yea? No? I'm a dumass. Whats my favourite music? I don't know, my favourite film?my favourite tv show? I don't know. What do you do harry? I play football, I watch sport, I live sport!!! But why are you always picked last at training when this is all you are? Your supposed to be good at your calling, no? Your supposed to be good at your favourite thing?....... I dunno.
I guess I'm good at going out with my mates and having fun but outside that I don't know where to start, just today I thought ill start swimming, that led to an obsession with wanting to start water polo, then I got tired and watched some tv, that 70s show came on then I wanted to be an actor, then I kept watching that 70s show and Fes convinced me I want to be good at dancing. I then listen to some music and I want to learn the piano. This is just today my mind changes like traffic lights but it doesn't stop at red the list is endless and I end up doing nothing, I wanted to be a pilot last week! You might say go for one but these things cost money for lessons for equipment like a piano and time which I seem to waste on a regular basis.
Have any of you advice for me as I said I'm happy but I could be happier with my mind at ease

TITLE:  Advice on suitable family dog for our family and lifestyle?
BODY: Hi there,

For sometime now we've been contemplating adding a new member to our family (a dog ofcourse! ^_^) who would be an ideal companion especially to my now semi-retired elderly parents. My folks also are keen on having a dog. 

We do have experience with dogs from other family and friends, but we have never owned one ourselves before. Ideally speaking we would like one who is capable of being gentle around very young children but when required also double up as guard/watch dogs. 

These days during the early mornings and evenings my mother loves going on long walks around our local area. We live in the city in a house with a medium size backyard and often stay during the weekends in the countryside at a friends farm. 

What concerns me is the rise in crime in the city I live in and when were in the country there are many wild animals as well when were walking out and about especially when it gets dark. It would certainly give all of us some piece of mind with an extra pair of eyes (or teeth if necessary) looking after the older and younger members when they are out of the house and not in our sights. 

While german shepherds and rottweilers come straight to mind, we are planning to be first time owners of a dog who "ideally" is also comfortable indoors in a medium sized home and does not shed too much hair.

Granted having said all of the above, just like a kid we are keen and willing to spend the time, money, training and patience on our dog. 

Thanks :-)

After taking a leak, he was still hard, and he got right back in me. Usually after we have sex, he urgently needs to relieve himself. He goes in and takes a really long pee. I'm really tight, so idk if that has anything to do with it. Sometimes when we do it, his d#ck gets semi-flaccid, even when he's EXTREMELY horny. I just thought men lose the urgency to urinate when aroused. Does he have a prostate problem? I know it's not him not being aroused enough, since I'm really attractive, he can't be around me without getting horny (and is never soft when I'm around), and

TITLE:  How to leave puppy alone for 8 hours +?
BODY: I got a puppy (Norfolk + Yorkshire terrier mix) 2 months ago

He s my 1st puppy so I read a lot online... At first he was put in crate and released to potty and each day/ week he got to spend more time roaming around

And since about 2 weeks ago I ve just kept the backyard door open and he does a great job going out to take care of his needs and he is free to roam around the house all day long (I m home with him) and most times when I go out I take him with me as well

But anyways I m about to get married and my family are coming to town so I need to take care of them and we are renting a condo (no dogs allowed)

I ll be gone for 2-3 weeks and my fiancé works 8 hr shifts and sometimes even longer; not to mention transportation (1 hr).... So it means our puppy is going to be alone for 8+ more... He has been doing so well potty training I m worried this will backfire... At first I considered asking my fiancé to keep him outside in the backyard while he is at work but our puppy is so small even the vet said maybe a bird will eat him or something...

We have a play pen thing too that we can keep him in or his crate (or is it called a kennel?)  but I don t know what we should do... 8-9 hours is a really long time...

He is a bit over 4 months old now...

At first I thought about just keeping him. Not restrained (like when I m at home) and just keep the backyard door opened but he is so young I m not sure letting him around the house unmonitored is a good idea for him..

The book belongs to the 45 minute library, and 2.) It's already in at the 45 minute library. The 30 minute library doesn't even have the book. I really want to read this book, but if we don't pick it up in 7 days they'll give it to the next person in line and my mom doesn't have to go near the library for 8 days so if we don't go soon I'll have to wait forever again.

TITLE:  My mom doesn't want me to see a doctor, help.?
BODY: About everything I've read online, I believe I have ADHD and fast metabolism.
But I can't be so sure so I really wanna see a doctor, also because I wanna know if I have allergies.
My mom always says that there is nothing wrong with me, even though I know there is.

Today she started yelling at me a told me that I'm crazy... Just because I believe I have those. I have every single symptoms of ADHD and I'm 40 kg (I think it's 90 pounds), never gain weight when I eat anything; Burgers, candy, etc.

Maybe I don't have ADHD or fast metabolism but I still want to see a doctor. Just in case..


I'm 14 years old, maybe it's normal for me to react or have stuff like that.
How can I convince my mom to go see a doctor?

(Sorry if something didn't make sence)

TITLE:  Could I be hallucinating? What does mean !?!?
BODY: So I feel like I'm starting to see things up until now &amp; I noticed this started happening in mid July. I think I might be hallucinating but only for a quick second, I'm not sure. Okay so I remembered I was on my bed, just browsing the web frm my fone&amp; then idk y I felt like I thought there was a tall black thing standing in front of me. So naturally I looked &amp; nothing was there. Also I would go to the basement to exercise because my parents put a treadmill there so as I'm running on it, I sometimes think there's something I see within the corner of my eyes. But then I'll forget about it &amp; just focus on my exercise. Today, my cat jumped on me at 5 am &amp; I couldn't fall asleep after that so I  was using my phone in bed &amp; after using it for half an hr, I saw a very quick squiggly line of red lights. I thought it could be a firefly. I saw it twice. But anyways, this (hallucinating?) usually happens like maybe 3 times or less in a week. Am I going crazy? Would love some feedback! Also, I'll comment/update this quest if u guys have any questions :)

TITLE:  Am I going through early menopause?
BODY: I know that is a leap for a 25 year old to assume, but heae out my reasoning.

1. I have missed a handful of bc pills in the past few months and never got pregnant from it.

2. I used to be all wet and ready to go before during and after sex, but now after about two minutes of sex I am dry as a bone.

3. On top of drying up, I can't orgasm to where any liquid comes out. I feel my muscles do all the orgasm stuff, but that's it. No *** at all. 

4. I got my period early by two weeks for three months now. I will get it, then it will just stay for about a week, than come back either the next week or week after that. It is getting ridiculous.

5. I feel like I'm going crazy. My emotions are all over the place, I go from hot to cold (physically), I'm always fatigue and I'm always hungry. 

I have been on Sprintec bc pills for almost a year, and I have dealt with stress for years so it is not stress related or adapting to bc pills. I am mot pregnant, so would it be logical to think I might be going through early menopause?

TITLE:  How do I fix a broken zipper on my jeans?!?
BODY: So I have this pair of jeans that I bought and the first time the zipper broke, the slider thing (I don't know what to call it) came off one of the tracks so it was just hanging on one side. I could fix that easily. But now when ever I zip my pants up, the zipper will stay together for like 5 minutes and then the actual zipper itself will come apart from the bottom. I don't know what to do! Luckily these jeans were really cheap, but I want to keep them because they are SOOOOO comftorable! So yeah, please help me out with this!

Edit: Also, it's not because the pants don't fit!

We had sex about 6 times that night we first had sex and that horrible smell came that evening. I have tried everything from supplements,  sticking probiotics up there and nothing!! My vagina doesnt tastes acidic like it usually does... But more like a battery or even shampoo. Help!

BODY: Since November 2014 I have gained 25 pounds. And since then I have eaten a daily healthy and balanced diet of 1600 calories a day. I also do a daily workout for 1 hour that burns about 400-500 calories. So how could I have possibly gained so much weight. I know its fat because I've barely gained any muscle since then and I look a lot fatter too and Im just about to give up hope because I can't stop the weight gain it is extremely frustrating.

TITLE:  Positive pregnancy test but started period? Please help!?
BODY: So I was a few days late on my period and I took a test. The line on the yes was extremely extremely light. It was there but it was very light. I think a day or two after that I started having cramps following with bleeding. I took two pregnancy tests before my period and they both said yes with faint lines. 

I thought I was on my period but I did research and learned that you can also bleed and have cramps in the early stages of pregnancy that some often mistake for a period. Also I ve had diarrhea (I know tmi) and I haven t had diarrea in years so I m not sure what to do.
Has anyone had this problem????

BODY: I just bought a Lenovo H50-05 PC. It has two HDMI ports; one on the video card and one on the motherboard. The one on the video card seems to be the only one working/activated. 
What I would like to know is, if it is possible to connect - let's say - my monitor to the HDMI port on the video card and my TV to the HDMI port on the Motherboard.

BODY: I just got my first bearded dragon yesterday. Here are my questions/concerns if you can help:
1. He hasn't eaten yet
2. The only way I got him to drink was when I dipped a Q-tip in his water dish and he licked the Q-tip
3. What does it mean when he opens his mouth and my hand is in the cage?
4. He really doesn't move much
5. I have his food right in the middle so it's not on the warm side or the cool side, is that what I should be doing? 
Thank you.

TITLE:  I planned a month long road trip/camping trip, and I'm begging to doubt myself.?
BODY: So I planned this amazing trip because couple of years ago someone I was interning for said to take advantage of my summers and travel. The trip would satisfy everything on my bucket list so far. I would travel from White Sands and end up at the Red Wood forest. I never got to travel during my childhood, so I supposed this explains the urge. But I also feel like if I do this, it will take away from a good opportunity to earn money for my second year of University. I really want to do this, but it's not financially smart. Any advice?

TITLE:  Iron deficiency in runners?
BODY: I am a high school runner who has been training all summer for this upcoming new cross country season. I am going to be a senior so I have a lot of experience with running and training, but unfortunately this past track season I had a season ending injury. I took probably 3 months off with cross training to fully heal and now I ve been back to running for 2 months but I am not the same. It s not like I was expecting to take all that time off and come back and be where I was, but I also didn t think that after 2 months of training I would be as fatigued and slow as I still am. My coach wants me to get bloodwork done and I was wondering what this could be, Iron deficiency? Or have I just lost my touch and am not as fast as I once was? This is really hard for me because I was planning on getting a scholarship to run in college but with how I m running now it doesn t seem likely

At first I was just getting rid of the suckers until I was able to pull out the root system.  Since they are doing so well, though...I thought maybe let one of the suckers grow to see if it will turn into a tree.  Anyone have any success or comments on whether or not this can work?

TITLE:  Badly screwed up metabolism?
BODY: To get straight to the point, I have been bulimic for the past 3 years or so. Also, on top of that, wanting to lose wight before school, I went on a very restrictive diet for a couple of days (ate around 500 calories w/ exercise.) However, now it seems like my metabolism is totally screwed up. After consuming 500 calories one day and running 3 miles, my weight went up by a pound! (and no, it is DEFINITELY NOT muscle.) If i even eat around 1000 calories my weight will go up by 2 pounds...and it is not water weight because the weight does not drop and will continue to increase until i do something rather drastic (like cutting calories or b/p.)

I'm also sluggish and tired ALL the time no matter what I eat or do. I feel like I'm pulling loads of sandbags whenever I run. I also have mood swings so I'm also thinking that I could have something along the lines of hypothyroidism. I don't know anymore..This whole weight thing is causing me so much stress, anxiety and even a bit of depression. So what do you guys think?

I actually lost 10 lbs just by eating healthier and riding my bike 3 miles a day. I just went for a 1 mile run and did it in TEN MINUTES! What! I used to be able to do it way faster! I have no motivation and just want to be in shape for the school year. I never knew how fast someone could lose there shape! How could I get in better shape? Keep running and biking everyday or what? And how can I keep my sweat level down, I had to stop running because there was a puddle underneath me on my sister's treadmill. I'm not supposed to be using it but she's at the beach :) thanks

TITLE:  Is it illegal for my dog to wear a vest written "Emotional Support Dog" if he ain't actually one?
BODY: I won't try to use it to fly and bring him anywhere illegaly as I've heard some poeple do so... I'm just talking about the vest thing.

I have huge emotional management issues and various distresses (I think I am Bordelrine) and my dog helps me so much getting some control back and stop harming myself/others when I am in crisis. That's why I think of him as a ESD, even if I don't have a prescription letter from a psychiatrist...

I'm trying to train him to redirects my attention if I'm hitting myself (I'd never hurt an animal, ever), getting angry and panicky - for exemple, pawing, barking, bringing me a toy... 

Also, let's imagine my doctor prescribes me a actual ESD, will I be able to keep mine as one?

Thank you so much in advance!

TITLE:  How can I quit smoking? Help!?
BODY: Hallo folks

I begun smoking years after I graduated from High School. I started smoking by asking friends if I could light the cigarette for them. At first It was a joke, I don't even remember how I got addicted. 

I used to smoke one packet in three days. There is a time when I started working night shift. I worked in night shits for seven years and there is where I got addicted to smoking and drinking coffee. Four years ago I stopped working night shifts. Coffee is something of the past in my life. It was very easy to quit. I don't even remember how I did it.

But smoking is different. If I miss a cigarette in seven hours I become nervous and get brutal with the family. I started snoring terrible. Not only that I gained weight of 27 kg in fours years. Yeah you read it right. I started working out sine two months ago. Lifting heavy iron and abdominal workouts. I can feel the difference in my body. Looking good at first since four years ago.

I did some calculations since two weeks ago. I smoked six packs of cigarettes in fourteen days. Nineteen cigarettes per pack. That makes me smoke eight cigarettes a day. 

I've been smoking for twelve years of my life. Now I just wanna quit for the sake my health and family. 

I read about other people's experiences but I wanna open my own page to quit the bad habit that is consuming my health.

How can I do that. Any advice or help will be well appreciated. Negative and positive opinions are all welcome. Cheers!

BODY: So I'm 16 and lift heavy things a lot from groceries to chores to my job as a cart guy for a supermarket. I had some scoliosis as a kid that was corrected so my spine is straight now without surgery but I'm worried cause I sometimes experience terrible lower back pain to where moving and picking stuff up is trouble. It happens when I lift too much and fixes eventually but is there something wrong or should I do something? I can't really go to a doctor right now.

I'm telling you, this little guy does not hold back. We noticed every time his: mom, aunt, and other siblings from the litter come close to him, or even try and pass, he hisses and screams at them. EXCEPT for one cat in the house, our fluffy white cat(girl).         He is very tense and seems scared. We have NO idea what is going on, and I really don't have to money to bring him to the vet.

TITLE:  Upper back pain?
BODY: I'm just a 14 year old girl. I've had back pain since I was 12. I think I've had back pain because of my tailbone. I broke it and it healed wrong and I had SHARP back pain on the lower part of my back and then I got a corizone shot and it helped the lower back pain but not the tailbone pain, and my upper back pain. Idk whats causing it but it wakes me up everyday to where I'm about cry on and can't move. What can I do to relieve the pain? And could my tailbone be the cause of the pain?

TITLE:  Did my aquarium filter overheat and if so will it ever turn back on?
BODY: I literally just bought this aqueon quetflow 30 for my tank. When I installed it I accidently pressed a button on my heater. A few hours later I walked in the room and the filter was not working. I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I read the thermometer and apparently my heater had heated the water all the way up to 95 degrees. I've been dumping ice cubes in ever since. Now I  got it down to 87 degrees but when I tried to turn the filter back on it didn't even make a noise. Is the filter busted for good or will it turn back on when it eventually cools down?

TITLE:  How can I help my knees for the time being..?
BODY: I'm 14 but lately my knees have been hurting badly. I have really flat feet, so usually when I work out I start having problems with knees/feet. Well I can't schedule a doctors appointment because my family and I are moving to a different state in like a week or so, and we are all frantically packing. But lately I have been going on a lot of walks, an occasional runs and ever since, my knees have been cramping up and hurting bad. I had to stop my exercising since 2 days ago, and I hate walking with a limp. I also noticed that if I lay or sit down after walking on it, it cramps up bad one final time before relaxing. Would a knee brace help? Advil, anything? Like I said I can't really go to a doctor just yet, and I don't think it's even close to being serious enough to go to the ER for immediate attention. I just would like to know some alternatives so I can help my family with the move :)

TITLE:  Savings Bond interest?
BODY: A few years ago, my mother passed away, leaving me with some US savings bonds.  On her final tax return, I included all the interest that the bonds had accumulated up until her date of death and paid the taxes on that interest income.

This year I plan to cash in the bonds and as I understand it, will only have to include the amount of interest the bonds have earned since her date of death on my taxes.  My question is:  How do I communicate to the IRS that the bulk of the interest on the bonds I am cashing in has already been reported and the taxes paid on my 2015 tax return?

I believe mine goes clockwise but I will check by cranking the engine or turning it over and just checking with the crankshaft pulley marks. I just want to double check before turning the crankshaft pulley to rotate it the way the engine moves im doing a valve adjustment and timing check with the cam gears.

TITLE:  How long will it take to regain my gains?
BODY: So 3 weeks ago I was 70kg, body fat % was pretty low at about 10% and I had a lotta lean muscle as I've been working out consistently for the best part of two years. 

I've recently gotten surgery on my jaw which is preventing me from training for 6 weeks and I'm on a liquid diet also. So in other words I'm in a weight lifters nightmare. 

I'm nearly 2 weeks into the 6 week period and I've lost 8kg and look a lot skinnier. My gains seem to be fading away. So my question is once I go back to the gym and can eat right how long will it take me to be back to the point I was once at.( assuming I hit the gym everyday) 

PS. I may lose more weight over the next 4 weeks.

TITLE:  How do you teach a cat not to bite?
BODY: I adopted a stray a few weeks ago, the vet said he's 6-9 months old. 
He's usually very sweet, but sometimes he bites and when he does it's really violent. I had to be on antibiotics from an infection I got from one of his bites for over a week and then the antibiotics caused me all sorts of other problems. I also have two other cats and I don't want him to bite them so I've been keeping him separated from them since we got him. 
He also likes to scratch, you can hardly pet or play with him for very long before he gets excited and starts trying to bite and claw you. 

The first time he bit me was the first night I brought him in and the second time was just now when we were trying to introduce him to one of the other cats and he clawed at them. My boyfriend tried to pick him up to separate them (bad idea trying to pick him up when he was scared) and he bit him and drew blood. He only bites hard when he's scared, which I understand, but I just don't want him to bite my other cats. 
I don't know what to do, any helpful advice or anything would be much appreciated.

TITLE:  Why do people hate Ray William Johnson?
BODY: Like seriously, why are there so many haters just because his jokes are "different" and the Equals 3 videos are short and boring (and everyone follows Vine videos, which I don't even pay attention to). I find this guy to be far more hilarious than any of those popular channels like Nigahiga (he's done, he can't come back anymore), Smosh, College Humor, and even Pewdiepie at times.

The reason he repeats his jokes is because it never ends, it always brings laughter, but since almost everyone on here thinks he's a bastard and a hotshot are just jealous of his creativity. Other channels are funny in their own way, but just because RWJ's humor is unique and killing doesn't make anyone have the right to criticize him for being a former top Youtuber.


Why though? Why are people bashing on him for being so good? Besides, he isn't the popular anymore right? Then why all the hate?

TITLE:  Dog's axillary lymph node active, what could it mean?
BODY: I came back from a one month vacation. Yesterday, I was getting ready for bed and had my cousin's dog next to me. When I was rubbing her belly, I discovered a lump under her skin. I knew this was not normal. Today I did some research and I was correct. It's an axillary lymph node.
My cousin's dog is a chihuahua.
Her age is unknown, all we can guess is she is kind of old since we found her while traveling. Though she doesn't appear to be having vision problems or anything and she had pups less than a year ago.
The lymph node is about the size of a pea.

Does anybody know what could be making her lymph node active?

TITLE:  I'm a 15 y/o girl and I've always wanted to dance, mainly hip hop, but I've always been stuck doing things that I like less, like soccer.?
BODY: I think that taking hip hop might be the first thing I like to do, maybe even have a passion for. I don't care much what other people think, but I do a little. Is it weird to start this late? Will I be able to get in a class with people around my age? (For beginners) im pretty decent as of now at dancing, if that helps. I made the school dance team a few years ago but had to quit because it conflicted with cheer, and cheer has helped me with counts. I also teach myself dances from YouTube, and if I'm honest with my self I'm not awful. So, my question is, do you think I should do it? So I don't have regrets?

TITLE:  When will I get my braces off?
BODY: When I first got my braces on, I was told I would need them for a year to 18 months.    I was told that my bite was fine, just my teeth
 need to be straightened. Since then I have had to use springs and elastic rubber bands. And over the first 18 months my teeth got straighter however I then had a type two over bite. So I got a herbst appliance in and a rubber band that went across the front of mouth from bottom to top to bottom. I got the appliance off after 8 months but I continued to wear the rubber band. I thought at that point they would take the braces off. But at my next appointment they put braces back onto the teeth that they were removed from for the herbst. Since then they have not changed any of my wires, I am just wearing them. I have asked my hygienist when to expect the braces to come off to which the respond to with, well let s see how it looks next time and work from there. When do you think I will get my braces off?

TITLE:  I've been slowly losing my appetite, why might that be?
BODY: Lately I haven't eaten as much as I used to. I've went from eating full steaks to maybe 1/4 of a steak. And eating 3-4 slices of pizzas to 1. My stomach has been hurting a lot lately which I believe is from dehydration and which when I drink a lot of water, I slowly feel better. I've thrown up many times on rare occasions after forcing myself to eat what I normally do. Nothing depressing has happened lately for me so I believe I am not depressed.

TITLE:  Burn and how to manage pain? What degree of burn is it?
BODY: I burnt it on a curling iron that was 330 degrees Fahrenheit. Right away it was a greenish color and already blistering. Once the initial burning part was over there wasn't really any pain at all. It's been 3 or 4 days and it's now hurting pretty badly. The skin is indented and around the burn is a pink outline. The skin is almost a dark purple/ brown with the green as well. I've been using aloe Vera and neosporin (not mixed) and gauze and non stick gauze pads. Also I've left time to keep it uncovered and exposed to air. Any tips on how to help it heal faster, deal with pain, and what degree of burn this would be classified as?

TITLE:  Can some one explain to me using an analogy what is an instance variable?
BODY: I was reading a pretty cool pdf that explains java programming using analogies which is pretty great but there's one thing they left out.
Here's an excerpt
" A car ,besideshavingcapabilitiestoaccomplishtasks,alsohasattributes,suchasitscolor, itsnumberofdoors,theamountofgasinitstank,itscurrentspeedanditsrecordoftotal milesdriven(i.e.,itsodometerreading).Likeitscapabilities,thecar’sattributesarerepresentedaspartofitsdesigninitsengineeringdiagrams(which,forexample,includean odometerandafuelgauge).Asyoudriveanactualcar,theseattributesarecarriedalong withthecar.Everycarmaintainsitsownattributes.Forexample,eachcarknowshow muchgasisinitsowngastank,butnothowmuchisinthetanksofothercars.

Sorry about not spacing the words but unfortunates my device doesnt seem to recognise the spaces between the words,  anyway as you can see for yourself the writer has used great analogy but forgot an left out about this so called "instance variables" and how are they different from class variables and please use an analogy to explain.The only knowledge I have in java is basic only:the difinition of a class, a method and object.

BODY: I have a double tail male betta fish and 3 Cory catfish in a 10 gallon, heated, and filtered tank. I've had them in it for about a month and the first couple weeks, the water was clear and fine. But a few days ago, it started getting really cloudy. So I thought it was the filter so I bought a new one but still no change after almost a week. I did like 2 water changes after it started looking cloudy and still no change. I feed the catfish sinking shrimp pellets and they never made my water cloudy before and I make sure to never over feed my betta. I use water conditioner as well every time I do a water change. The fish seem fine and they're swimming and eating as normal. I told my mom I wanted a test kit to test the water parameters but she says I don't need it. What should I do?

Saturday I thought it was my period. Very light cramps, and I only saw blood about twice in the toilet when I peed, but not as much as usual. I think I only filled two panty liners that day.
Sunday more brown spotting. Blood here and there very much lighter than Saturday.
Monday I had brown spotting with maybe a drop or two of blood.
And then this morning only a drop when I wiped. And some brown spotting.
No cramping after Saturday. 
Soooooo could I possibly be pregnant or was that just a very weird period? I m just asking for opinions before I go to a dr or buy a test.

TITLE:  My car won t go over 20mph?
BODY: The rpm goes up to 5-6, but my car won t go up past 20mph. The check light isn t on, and it just randomly started happening when I was driving up a hill. Just last week I started hearing a fan-like noise after shutting off my car after a short 10-15 minute drive. I was going to take it to the autoshop soon, but haven t had the time. Any ideas?

BODY: My boyfriend and I recently moved in together and he has a very needy cat. He meows at night because he wants his attention and wakes me up. He has tried to train the cat for a few weeks, but nothing has changed (or minor improvement). I have told him that I cant live with the cat because of his needy behavior and waking me up during the night and this has led to many arguments and affected our relationship. Am I justified for telling him to give his cat away?

BODY: So I've been looking and YouTube videos and reading about how to pierce your own lip and I'm wondering now if I can use a sewing needle as I can't buy them needles you are supposed to use as I'm not telling my mum as she hate piercing.
So could I.....I'm buying lip rings and they are 16g so would it work with a sewing needle or what. Can you give me help on if it will work. Also I know how to clean the needle and what to do.
What would the consequences of me doing this. Someone said that you could lose the feeling on one side of your face and that's why I'm worried.
Also don't give me all that stuff about don't do it yourself I know it's bad but I really want it done and will it swell and if it does how long. 
So can I use a regular sewing needle?
Thank 🙌

TITLE:  What's the name of this dog breed?
BODY: Now my memory is a little hazy so certain details may be faded but when I was 5-6 years old my grandmom had a big black dog. His name was bear and he was pretty big, had thick-slightly curlygrey and black fur, pointed ears, snout like a German shepherd, the front portion of his body was lot bulkier than his back portion. He had a very fluffy tail which curved inward. This dog was probably about the size of a st. Bernard. If he'd lived longer (someone in the neighborhood poisoned hm), there would probably be finer details but all of this is pretty much speculation.

BODY: Hey there, I really need help with my laptop. It s a macbook, 7 years old, but something is wrong. I was on safari and pages at the same time, and i closed both at the same time and got a rainbow spinning wheel. Being impatient, i restarted my computer, only to see what when i started it up; i had a gray folder with a question mark inside it blinking. It did not go away for a couple hours, so i looked up what do to. I inserted my OSX Snow Leopard disk and held the option key. My laptop started up but Apple Support told me to ignore the installation page after i selected my language (english) and to click on the Disk Utilities option. But see, here s the other problem, it didn t give me any option to repair any disks because all i had was a BAD SHUTDOWN, there were no disks to repair! I don t know how to fix it with nothing to repair, and i don t have the money to take it into any stores, please help.

TITLE:  Root canal follow-up treatment hurts?
BODY: I had a root canal done on a lower molar a while ago, and while the root canal procedure didn't hurt by itself, the follow-up procedure on the next appointment hurt to the point I passed out and the treatment had to be cancelled.

That tooth is still untreated to this day, and today I had another root canal in another tooth (I switched dentists after that incident), so in a 1-month period I'm looking into 2 root canal follow-ups to finish treating both teeth.

I am quite scared because I'm afraid that what happened last time will happen again. What, in your opinion, is to blame? The old dentist blamed my nervousness (in all fairness she told me I didn't even need to be numbed down, then she injected me 4 or 5 times, 2 of them in the cheek) and told me I needed to be sedated for this treatment to work.
She also said there was no way to get through the root canal follow-up without pain.

Do you think she was right? Or was all that pain due to her poor technique? Is pain unavoidable on the root canal follow-up, or will a normal anesthesia do the trick?

TITLE:  Kind of worried, need some reassurance.?
BODY: So me and this girl have been talking for about three months now, shes been going under a lot of stress because of her terrible ex boyfriend. It was a very abusive relationship and he still does the same crap to her, very stressful. Im trying my hardest to help her through it. But that beside the point, me and her had sex. All protected, never once went inside of her without a condom. Never finished, checked the condoms i used. But her period came two weeks early, and i was reading and it said it could mean either contracting an std, pregnancy, miscarriage and stress. Ive ruled out the first two because of the situations and i know im clean, as well as the third because not once did penetrate her. Shes super worried and its getting to me, is she over thinking everything? Oh yeah forgot to mention the period was very heavy, and shes been experiencing a lot of cramps.

TITLE:  Why is DeflateGate such a big deal?
BODY: My personal opinion about DeflateGate is it has much to do about nothing. I am a Pats fan, so I am biased but all of this evidence below is factual. 

The Colts intercepted the ball, complained that it was deflated, so the balls got reinflated at halftime, and after that the Patriots went on a 28-0 run. 

And if it was really that big a deal wouldn't the Refs have made the Patriots change the ball during the game. The refs touch the ball basically every play and they didn't even know. 

And I thought about this and thought to myself what a dumb excuse. Say you were playing backyard football, and the other team was destroying you guys, and you finally got an interception and then complained that the reason they were doing so good was because the balls were deflated. What a silly excuse. The Pats were probably worse with the deflated footballs anyway. 

And the NFL went on a manhunt to ruin Brady's legacy. Their only goal in this whole Deflategate thing is to punish Tom Brady, they don't care about anybody else involved. Just so silly in my opinion.

In urban culture there is an area in the United States known as "The Dirty South". The states included in this area are the following states: Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North and South Carolina. Even though El Paso is in Texas is it still considered Dirty South? It is located far west of Texas and it s only a few minutes away from New Mexico and very close to California. Are far west cities of Texas still considered "Dirty South"?

BODY: I've had my iPhone 4s for about 2-3 years now, an have had issues in the past with it restarting on its own, dying with virtually a full battery, literally freezing for hours, and just all around slowness. Those problems disappeared when I upgraded to iOS8 but a few days ago a new problem arose, when my sound kept disappearing. Literally the sound bar and general sound was gone completely. So I looked up on YouTube what the matter was and I brushed it an cleaned all the ports and holes and such. It came back, but only for about 5-7 minutes and it was out again. Restarting and restoring the phone did not help either. Now it comes and goes as it pleases whether I have headphones in or not. What is going on?

I might have done it over 8 times i guess in 3-4 days time. My body was saying no but anyways i did it. At the end i did ejaculate but i felt very painful and the pressure was imbalance. It felt like Closing the tip of syringe and pulling it backwards. I was so scared took shower to come out of that drug i took it. Then I didnt masturbate for couple of days and tried again to see if its cured but no :(. I get ***** and i come to the climax but still i am having the same problem and i tried last night too. I am having same problem. Now its scaring hell out of me will this cause me for my relationship in future. Should i consult doctor about this right away or is it common for men will face some time and gets better? Any suggestion will help me out. I really appreciate it. Thank you.

TITLE:  How to get chosen in a TV show about modeling?
BODY: Me and my boyfriend submitted an application form for a Tv show called Venere. it's a show which 8 models are chosen which do different photoshoots with different themes. This season is season number 4 and thousands of people apply for it but only 8 are chose..next week there is the casting date and I'm super nervous. What should I expect ? What are they looking for ? I really want to get chosen, even my boyfriend. It would be a dream come true for both of us. Do looks matter ? or facial expressions , attitudes? What should we wear? A lot of makeup? Thanks guy and I would appreciate a lot !

TITLE:  Is my sister a food addict? My family can't control her eating?
BODY: I'm 5'6" around 115 lbs and male, I have a really high metabolism because I play a lot of sports and I like to stay active and workout, my sister is 4'11" around 240 lbs, maybe more. What's weird is she's the only fat person in my family.

My family can't control her eating, yesterday my dad brought home 12 burgers from a BBQ, my mom found out today that my sister ate all of them in one day!!! No one got any burgers! My mom was mad at herself because whenever my dad bring homes food like that she usually babysits the food to make sure my sister doesng finish them, the one day she doesn't watch the food she finished it all in one day. There's only one left. Whenever we buy food she finishes it off the same day. She finishes off entire packs of bread in a day, my moms friend bought Italian ices, 2 boxes, 12 total, they were gone in a day. Is she a food addict? We can't not have food in the house, everyone else is slim and active with fast metabolisms and needs the food, but we hardly get a chance to eat the food before my sister finishes it off. This is so frustrating, annoying, and disgusting!! I wanted a burger!

TITLE:  Need ideas for a character's wardrobe/hair and name?
BODY: Not for a book, just my own made up story 

Her personality is generally reserved and passive, so it has to be something that doesn't attract too much attention, though a small unique accessory would be ok. 

She's also very artistic, and loves to read and study on events from older time periods 

And she is 19, but is not very modern like other people her age and is somewhat of an outcast (not a goth/emo type, unless it was romantic or victorian goth, probably? but toned down)....some of her views and interests might be seen as boring or prudish. 

And although she is artistic she's not the type to get tattoos or dye her hair with wild colors. She's not very rebellious. But maybe something that's dark, but more subtle or soft and less tough would work? 

I have more info on her, but I'm sticking to basic and relevant details for now...

TITLE:  How long does it take to "recharge"?
BODY: Last weekend me and my girlfriend really enjoyed ourselves at her parents place that was on a cruise all week. I've never, ever done it that many times (I think 9 or 10 times from late Friday night until Sunday morning!) I haven't even jacked it that many times on a full weekend!

What made it very enjoyable is she started using birth control pills about 2 months ago and don't use condoms anymore...however, I still enjoy a pull out shot from time to time.

I noticed after the 3rd time of orgasm my "fluid" was not coming out very much and she asked why. I told her it has to "recharge". I didn't know the scientific reasoning of it but I think it takes like 12 hours or so I dunno?

TITLE:  I don t know if I want to live anymore?
BODY: I am 15. I suffer from schizophrenia, chronic insomnia, depression, chronic migraines, and chronic fatigue. Everyday I wake up to hell. My migranes are so bad I can almost never go out side, and when I do, I have to wear prescription sunglasses. I can t walk in the heat or I ll get sick. 
From the migraines come the fatigue. It s getting hard to do simple things like turn the doorknob or lift my arms to brush my teeth. Everything is tiring, but because of my insomnia I can t sleep it away. 
My insomnia and schizophrenia like to feed off of each other. I hear voices talking in my head and watch demons crawl out of my floor every night. I also have intense paranoia to the point where I ve covered all my windows and air vents, and all my device cameras because people are watching me. I have also "seen" a man in my house for the last 3 days. Normally I get about 3 hours of sleep a night. 
My chronic pain will only grow worse as I age. I m weak from fatigue and lack of sleep, and my schizophrenia is worsening. I can t get painkillers for my migraines because my parents think I ll become suicidal. Ah, the irony. There is no convincing them otherwise about the painkillers, I ve already tried and reasoned and gotten punished for speaking up. 
I don t know what to do.

TITLE:  Personal opinion for a Long Range Rifle cartridge?
BODY: Hello. A couple days ago I decided to look into building or buying a long range rifle. So what would you guys recommend build it from the ground up or just buy one and then start customizing it or changing things were they need to be changed?  Also what cartridge would you guys recommend. I'm 16 and I'm always been around guns. My family's really big into hunting. But I won't be using this for hunting just for long range target practicing.  But I don't think a 300 win. mag. Or a .308 lapua would be a good cartridge simply because the recoil from it dosent makebit enjoyable to shoot for me. Any suggestions will help.

TITLE:  Need help with USMC?
BODY: So I have a quick question, and not saying im going to do it, but every year my family likes to go on a cruise, this year they are  repeating last years cruise that goes to catalina island and then to ensenada Mexico. Ensenada is not a forbidden place but it is technically another country.  The cruise only stays there for like 10 hours then comes back into the US. Now, im debating on whether I should just take leave and go on the cruise keep it on the low and just come back when its over, but im curious if I did that I would actually get caught up? Im just debating right now. I havent seen my family in 7 months,  so I was hoping to go on the cruise.. but if you think I would really get caught let me know. Thanks a lot

TITLE:  Is pooping on the floor of a public restroom a good practical joke?
BODY: Before you tell me I'm immature or a child, let me tell you I am a fully grown adult and I take pooping very seriously. I enjoy pooping on things as a practical joke and I am also a certified professional. I've run into legal troubles numerous times but each time I am able to negotiate my way out with little losses except for maybe small fines I am forced to pay and/or legal fees.
Now that I have that out of the way, I've mapped out the public restrooms around my area of Ventura County. I've found the layout of certain restrooms (especially the one by the family arcade at the Ventura Harbor village) are perfect for a new pooping experimentation idea I have. It's set up so that when you enter the restroom you then are forced to make a sharp left turn to reach the urinals and stalls. I sleep in this restroom every now and then (I don't have a home because I can't get a job for whatever reason. I think it's the reverse discrimination at work...) and I've noticed that many of the men who walk in don't watch their step. I could strategically place a poop right where they turn so that stepping on it (or having a close call) will be almost unavoidable. What are your thoughts?

TITLE:  Did the nurse cause another stroke?
BODY: Hello, I had a stroke last week. The initial onset consisted only of half face drooping, tingling in extremities and difficult to walk/balance alongside slurred speech. On the way to the hospital, I felt fairly fine, just hot and a small headache.  I received a CT scan and MRi that showed swelling in my brainstem, so I was transferred to a neurosurgeon across town.  Before EMS came to take me, the nurse dropped my BP to normal levels(via Cardene) when my initial was BP was 222/147.  When they arrived, I went into paralysis in my left side and felt REALLY bad.  I really feel that her dropping my BP is what caused the stroke though I am not entirely knowledgeable of strokes, however I am medically inclined. If so, should I seek actin against the nurse? She honestly seemed incompetent compared to my latter nursing staff.  Thank you all, please list credentials. 

Peace.

Should my bolts be good from not breaking? I have no leaks I also tightened them to what I thought was good then went and rented a torque wrench and they just turned a slight bit so I had them close to the exact torque.

BODY: My anxiety has peaked and my mind is really sensitive to things now. I notice that now when I wake up I get this really intense feeling of impending doom. Like someone really, really bad is going to happen. It scares me a lot but I try to calm myself down. Every day I either feel anxious or depressed or both. When I'm sleeping I get this random bout of high anxiety. Like I get scared for no reason and get butterflies in my stomach. Today I got that feeling and now it's gradually going away and I feel okay but I'm SCARED to feel okay. Because every day my anxiety and depression seem to be getting worse but today I feel kind of at peace. I'm scared to feel normal because I feel like it's not normal. I don't show signs of mania or bipolar or violent outbursts. I am just simply calm, like my normal self. Can anyone explain this? Maybe with your own experiences/if it's normal?

I always loved his dogs: energetic and charming, but he kept them very well trained. I'd like to buy a jack puppy in a few years when I can support one and have done more research, but I'd like to know exactly what I'm getting, which you generally can't through a shelter. I don't understand how people find reputable, responsible breeders near them. Is there some sort of registry? Do I just need to search jack russell forums?

BODY: Ok so I just moved into a townhouse... Didn t notice a smell at first... Now when I leave the house my clothes REEK of what smells like mothballs! The inside smells some but not near as bad as everything in my house! The weird thing is you cannot smell the mothball smell in the house, only when you take the items out. Not to be racist what soever, but there is an Indian couple who live next to mine... Is this curry or mothball smell? I have a fire wall b/t houses and do not share any air ducts or anything with either neighbors. I have checked attic for mothballs and nothing was found. I have brand new carpet/flooring and newly painted walls! Where could this smell be coming from?? And how do I get rid of it ASAP!

I told my mom and she said that her  and my dad will take care of her but I feel so guilty and I don't want her anymore and I know I'm horrible for thinking so, but I just feel too anxious and worried and I can't do anything. She's going to be home alone all day during the week because of school and work and I know it's wrong but my parents do not listen to me. I regret it. ):

Right now i give him about 20 things at a time and he eats it fast but he wants more food like every other hour. I know this because when hes hungry he goes to his feeding corner (literally only when hes hungry because the food is up against the tank in that corner)and  stands up and splashes water like crazy (especially if you walk past him or if you pick up his food and he witnesses you do it). He knows when he is full because when he is full he just doesn't eat or finish all the food.

BODY: This morning I put Apple cider vinegar on my wart and I took it off now (it's a little after 4 PM) and there is a hole right in the middle of the wart and it's black. Like someone literally poked something through my wart and I see black stuff. But to get to the black part, I pealed off the dead skin on top. It looks like it's healing though. My questions are: Is this a good sign? Am I doing everything correctly? And how long do you think at this rate, it'll take to completely remove it? School starts in mid September so hopefully it'll be gone by then! By the way if this helps, I have 1 wart on my left thumb and another on my right thumb. The location of it is in the squiggly lines of my thumbs

TITLE:  Beagle puppy not eating?
BODY: I have. 6 month old beagle puppy and from this morning she hasn't been eating at all. I try to hand feed her but she won't eat or drink. And it makes me really sad to watch her like this. Today I walked her and she ate grass and threw up a little but she still didn't eat. She keeps running back and forth with her toy bone. She is usually really crazy when I take her out of her crate but today she's coming out of the crate really quietly. I'm taking her to the vet soon but any advice?

TITLE:  Quitting the High School Football team?
BODY: I'm 17, going into senior year of High School, and have never played football before. I haven't done football in the past due to the financial and physical demand from it, but I thought I'd make this one exception because it's my senior year and my last chance to play High School football. I'm not enjoying my time with the team (even though I have good friends in the team) and it's getting more difficult to go to each practice. I don't want to be labeled a quitter and leave the team; however, the financial demand is ridiculous, this year is the most important to focus on grades, and again, I'm not enjoying the sport. I have dedicated a lot of time and effort into the team, but I can't take it anymore. How do I approach my coach and tell him this without making him upset, or is that inevitable?

TITLE:  What could be wrong with my knee?
BODY: Okay I'm just really curious because something has to be causing the pain. I have very flat feet, and a weird balance. Usually when I run I get a stinging/sharp pain in my foot, but recently my knee has been hurting bad. The past 2 weeks I have been going on a lot of walks and occasional a jog. It cramps up and hurts to Stand on it, and sometimes when I sit or lay down after walking on it, it cramps up badly one last time before relaxing. I'm tired of limping around, and I can't go to the doctors due to house moving issues right now. I'm currently using a knee brace and that helps a little bit, but any idea what could be wrong with it? I've noticed my foot also turns awkwardly to the side so I'm just curious. (both knees hurt but my right knee is worse).

TITLE:  Really, how bad is weed for you?
BODY: I'm 16 years old and I've recently got into smoking weed with my friends. I've been high about 3 times so far, and honestly I think it's a lot of fun. However, obviously I've been warned about it by parents, school etc.

I'm not completely deluded. I know weed is not GOOD for you, by any stretch of the imagination. However, from reading around the internet, and talking to and observing others, I believe that when smoked in moderation/infrequently, marijuana is unlikely to inflict any significant harm. In honesty, I regard weed as safe, if not safer, than alcohol, but the only difference between the two being that marijuana isn't socially acceptable. However, I'm not ignorant to the fact that if smoked frequently, marijuana will eventually harm your health.

I most certainly don't think I would become addicted to marijuana; whilst I enjoy it, I definitely think I could live without it.

What do you guys think? From your own experiences/education, do you think smoking weed occasionally will inflict any significant harm on a person's health? How frequently do you think weed can be smoked to ensure avoidance of health issues? Help would be appreciated. Thank you.

TITLE:  Is the Civil Rights Act of 1964 a primary source?
BODY: According to princeton.edu - A primary source is a document or physical object which was written or created during the time under study. These sources were present during an experience or time period and offer an inside view of a particular event.
I'm unsure if it's a primary source because it was created during that time period but it does not provide an inside view of the event. This is for a project to find certain primary sources create DBQ questions based on them, so it being a primary source or not is very important for the resulting grade.
Thank you.

TITLE:  How do I tell my parents I hear voices in my head?
BODY: I am a 14 year old girl and I have been hearing voices for about 8-9 months now. I have decided to tell my parents as I no longer feel I have any control. I mean that I used to be able to block them out by listening to load music in my earphones or something but it hasn't worked for the past few months. Also they are getting louder and more controlling and scarier to me. Recently I have been doing more of what they tell me. They have told me to self harm and kill myself and I consider it now. This is making me scared so I want to tell my parents but I don't know how. I have never really been that confident so I don't know if I would be able to bring myself to tell the in a conversation unless someone told me how to. Also I don't want people to think I'm mad so I only want to tell my parents. I have 2 sisters and 2 brothers so I don't know if I want to tell them either. Any advice would be great thanks.

TITLE:  Physical Remote for Macbook Pro Retina?
BODY: I need a physical remote so dont tell me to get an app on my iphone, i dont want that. 


Ok so the macbook pro retina does not have an IR receiver built in so I have a few options. 

I can buy a ir receiver adapter for my macbook pro and use an apple tv remote to control my mac.

I can buy a bluetooth remote to control my mac (the only problem I have with this is that some of them after 15 minutes of inactivity it has to reconnect, so I have to wait 10 seconds and then press pause when I'm watching a movie which is annoying.

So does anybody know a good ir receiver adapter or a good physical remote for my macbook pro that does not disconnect after inactivity.  thanks

TITLE:  My friend's diet?
BODY: there was a previous question about this but my friend took a picture of her diet plan for the first 3 days. 
DAY 1
B: 1 slice toast ( 83 calories)
L: 1/2 grapefruit (41 calories)
D: 1 medium apple (undecided )
DAY 2
B: 1 egg (78 calories)
L: toast (83 calories)
D: 1 cup of broccoli (35 calories)
DAY 3
B: 1 small apple (52 calories)
L: 1 hard boiled egg (78 calories)
D: 1 cup watermelon (undecided )
-
im really worried about her. Its unhealthy to have only 100 calories a day, and not to mention having a fast beat 400-500 calorie daily exercise (but she's drinking a lot of water)
She thinks she can loose 15 pounds with this. How do I convince her to not go with this diet plan?

TITLE:  First Day of School Outfit?
BODY: I'm going into middle school in about a week and I have no idea what to wear! I'm thinking about some skinny boot cut jeans I got, would that be okay?
For my school shopping the only shirts I got were the ones that said Aeropostale in big letters on the front, would one of those be okay?
Should I wear jeans or shorts (no skirt)?
Also the only shoes I have are black converse, black and white flip flops, green/pink sports shoes, pink and black sports shoes, high heeled black boots, and blue and red sandals. 
Any hairstyle ideas are appreciated. 

Thankyou!

-BB cream
-Concealer (not under eyes)
-Powder
-Shimery eyeshadow (you can only see the shimmer a little bit)
-Curl my lashes (Because I have naruraly really long eyelashes so whenever I wear mascara it looks like I'm wearing falsies)

So yea! My mom said it looks nice and so do my friends. So I'm guessing that it's ok but I just want to know if the amount of makeup is ok.

TITLE:  Nuva ring fell out?
BODY: Before I even start, yes I have read the paper that comes with it. So now, I put my ring in on August 7th after a very light period, and it is now August 11th and I just realized my ring is not in. I have no clue when I lost it. How likely am I to be pregnant? After my light period I thought I might be because I never have light periods. (I have been having my period regularly since I was 9, I am now 19). 

Please no lectures on how I shouldn't be having sex, I am engaged and getting married in a few months.

TITLE:  Something wrong with the Fanfiction website?
BODY: When I go into any of the archives no stories show up, it just says "No entries found with current filters. Note: M rated entries are not displayed by default. Please expand your filter". My filter is always set to k-t but I checked the filter anyway and it is, but I also noticed that character filters are missing.

Is anyone else having this problem? Why aren't any stories showing up? I know there wasn't a sudden mass deletion because I see my stories still up on my profile.

TITLE:  Does wearing makeup make you a hoe?
BODY: So I was talking to my "best friend" and I told her that I fill in my eyebrows with powder because I have light eyebrows and I want to make myself feel just prettier and it just makes me feel more confident but when I tell her that she says no you do it for other people and she calles me fast and she recalls the time when I was younger and said make up is for ugly hoes but then I told her it was a long time ago and I was stupid and she said I'm turning into one, and she says in the future I'm gonna have a full face of makeup and I'm gonna be a fast hoe, btw I'm 12 and I only wear eyebrow powder, and lipstick for special occasions, but she said it doesn't matter makeup is makeup and your fast and your a hoe. God I just hate when she says that I feel like people wear makeup to make themselves feel confident but I'm 12 and I only wear brow powder on a daily basis, and it's not a Jurassic change, but I do believe you shouldn't wear a lot of makeup like ALOT until your 16 but I don't understand why she calls me a hoe and I explained to her why I wear only eyebrow powder and I only wear lipstick like 5 times a year, but she still calls me a fast hoe 😕 share your thoughts

TITLE:  What gaming monitor should I get for a new PC build with a GTX 970?
BODY: I just made my first PC build with a GTX 970, and I was wondering what monitor would help me get the most performance out of it. I am wanting to budget myself at $200 and personally care a lot more about the quality and color of the images more than things such as response time. I've heard IPS is the best panel, and was looking for monitors with an IPS panel and found this http://tinyurl.com/qxlagdb which looked decent for what I was looking for, but had mixed reviews and left me unsure. I also was looking at A BenQ monitor http://tinyurl.com/q5j3dtz and an Asus monitor http://tinyurl.com/nw8mhzp which were both well received. What left me uncertain though was that they had TN panels which in reviews said would have lower picture and color quality. I'd also like at least two HDMI ports so I can hook up both my computer and my PS4 to the monitor. As I said this is my first build, so I'm not sure what is optimal, but am open to any and all suggestions. Obviously I would prefer something with 144Hz or 1440p, but am not expecting anything like that from my price range Thanks again.

The incoming freshmen in my school add up to about 1,000 students. Meaning, that a lot of people are going to try out. I also have a little hard time running, I take 8-9 minute miles.
Will my mile time effect my chance? Or performance? 
What should I expect at tryouts? 
Do I have a chance of getting in?

TITLE:  How does Windows 10 battery saver feature function with the regular battery settings ported over from Windows 8?
BODY: For example, if I m in "High Performance" mode, and then I hit "Battery Saver" in the Windows 10 interface, the high performance box is still ticked in the control panel battery settings. So what does this mean? Does the new battery saver option override anything here? Or will I see battery improvements by having them both on "Power Saver" and "Battery Saver"? 

Additionally, does anybody know how to switch between "Balanced" and "High Performance" like you used to be able to, at the click of a button? With the introduction of Windows 10, you have to go through 2 interfaces to get there, whereas before you simply had to click the battery icon. This is a real annoyance, considering there is a lot of empty space for more battery options at the moment when you click the battery in the taskbar. 


Hoping someone out there knows some answers! 

Thanks

TITLE:  Medical Advice needed.?
BODY: I'm 20 years old, never smoked, don't drink, never done street drugs. Only ever slept with one person and we've been in a commited relationship for several years now so STD's are out of question. The last 5 months now my mouth has been really weird. My Symptoms:
1. The back of my tongue on the sides feels weird on and off and on some days I feel like something is stuck on the sides of my tongue but then that feeling goes away.
2. My tongue gets white but then returns to normal color.
3. My gums get swollen, but they don't bleed. And sometimes my teeth feel out of place and loose but then return to normal after a few days. 
4. I keep on getting pimples on my neck which I haven't really gotten before. 
I have been to my Primary DR. and I have also been to the hospital twice and they all ran different blood work and urine samples and they found nothing wrong. 
What else could it be though?? I don't understand.

Am I supposed to check in online 24 hours ahead of time or is that optional?

Do I check in online and check in at the ticket machine at the airport?

Do I only have to check in at the ticket machine at the airport?

Can I print my ticket when checking in online and skip the ticket machine in general?

This is a flight from Florida to Texas.

BODY: I'm 16 years old and I recently got back from the philippines for 2 months. I went to the dentist and the hygienist said she didn't see any cavities after cleaning. The dentist said she saw a couple, so later the hygienist told me I had a couple. I've never had cavities ever and my last checkup was a little less than a year ago. It ends up I had 5 cavities! My dad was pissed at me but I got them all filled (honestly my teeth hurt more after than before I got fillings). I try to brush my teeth twice a day (I forget sometimes but still, I've never had cavities right?) however, in the philippines my aunt was spoiling me with so much food, but I don't drink soda or eat candy. Maybe her toothpaste has no fluoride? The dentist was showing my dad the xrays and everything but is there a way to fake it? This is a new dentist btw.

TITLE:  Small upright, green Japanese Maple for Zone 5?
BODY: I have a small front yard and want to find a small maple. It has to tolerate FULL SUN and cold Indiana (ZONE 5) winters. I love vase shaped trees and fell in love with the coral bark maple but others have warned me they won't survive the winter. I then wanted a paperbark maple but I'm told it wouldn't do well at all in full sun. I want green leaves...any suggestions?

TITLE:  Please tell me this is normal?
BODY: Sometimes, while I'm trying to fall asleep, I'll hear voices. Like, Once I heard a man say my name pretty clearly and loudly. I wasn't quite asleep yet so I got up and opened my door, thinking it could have been my dad, but he was working in his office on the other side of the apartment. Another time when I was falling asleep, I heard someone whispers "goodnight". It sounded like it was right in my ear so I got pretty freaked out because both my parents where in another room and there's no way I could hear them whisper that clearly. Sometimes when I'm trying to fall asleep, I'll here a man's voice ask "Are you ok?" or "You alright?" Now my parents do sometimes watch tv at night but it sounds like it's in my room. After that, it will take me a while to relax again in order to go to sleep. Now I don't believe in ghosts so I don't want any ghost answers. And I don't see things and I never hear voices any other time of the day except for when I'm trying to fall asleep. It's not dreams though because I'm not actually asleep yet. I don't want to tell anyone this in person because they might assumeI'm schizophrenic or something.

TITLE:  How long does it take to get a six pack abs??? As a woman?
BODY: I'm 27, 5'1 and I was 90 lbs a month ago. I started doing boxing and kickboxing 4-5  times a week and light weights two times a week. I eat really healthy. I am a vegetarian so I eat tons of fruits, veggies, egg whites, etc. I don't really eat bread etc. My intake is about 1900-2300 calories a day and about 80-120 gm protein a day. I have been tracking this for the last month. It's now a month later and I am 100 lbs. I look more muscular to and bigger in a good way. I can see my ab muscles developing and getting more defined but they aren't where I want them yet. Before I started working out at a gym, I was running anywhere from 6-15 miles and I did that for a year 3-4 times a week. But I got injured and took six months off. 

I was just wondering how long it actually take to get them???

TITLE:  For SHORT FAT GIRLS (4'11" or under and 175 lbs. or over): What is THE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT of THE TALLEST, SKINNIEST GUY you overpowered?
BODY: I am A TALL SKINNY GUY. I remember one SHORT FAT GIRL I encountered. She told me she lifts weights so she and I decided to engage in a weightlifting contest. We decided on the clean and jerk (the "clean" means lifting it over the shoulders and the "jerk" means lifting it overhead). We were both in reasonably good health despite my being VERY TALL AND VERY SKINNY and despite her being VERY SHORT AND VERY FAT!!! I stood 6-foot-1 and I weighed 125 pounds while she stood 4-foot-9 and she weighed 230 pounds. I invited her over to my apartment where I had a barbell set. We set the barbell up on the floor. The fully-loaded barbell weighed 150 pounds (more than my own body weight!!!). While she was watching me, I grabbed it from the floor and I tried to lift it over my head. I COULDN'T EVEN GET IT ABOVE MY KNEES!!! Then came her turn. While I was watching her, she grabbed it from the floor and then she swung it up over her shoulders (lifting it EASILY above her shoulders!!!). While I continued to watch her, she easily lifted that fully-loaded barbell RIGHT UP OVER HER HEAD!!! I became awfully embarrassed, not only because of my being a male and her being a female but also because I STOOD WAY TALLER THAN SHE DID!!! In fact (I was bare chested) I stood so much taller than she did that my nipples actually rose WELL ABOVE HER MOUTH!!! I was looking way down at her while she was looking way up at me when she and I suddenly began kissing each other tenderly and passionately!!!

After I got i back it would freeze with a flickering screen and i would have to manually shut it down. This would happen very often and every once in awhile it would give me the 3 beep ram error. When this happened i would open up the bottom and reseat the ram but this would never fix tbe problem. I finally decided to buy one 8gb ram stick to replace the two 4gb original ramsticks but after a week the same problems started to happen again. Please help i dont know what else to do as I go back to school very soon and would like to completely fix this problem.

TITLE:  Should I play in open-court racquetball?
BODY: I am a 13 year old boy who would consider himself to be a racquetball prodogy. I have played against very good adults and friends  set on beating me. My local 24 hour fitness has open court (meaning that you sign up on a sheet and face the winner of a previous match who is usually a stranger). But I am concerned to do this. I am worried for several reasons:

1. Everybody who I played with was going easy on me and I am not as good as I thought. 

2. The adults who I face in the court will not take me as seriously due to my age and go easy. 

3. Nobody will want to face me because of my age. 

So this leads me to my question: should I play open court racquetball or wait until I am older?

BODY: I went out today to my balcony and decided to get a tan. I stayed in the sun for 30 min on the front and 20 on the back. 

I was thinking of doing it every day but I'm not sure if that's a good idea, since I heard about skin cancer and all that.

So I was wondering is it okay to tan every day? Or should you wait a day then go the next etc etc? And how long should I tan for? I don't want to overdo it and hurt my skin. Thanks in advance!

TITLE:  Need advice on my car, what would cause.....?
BODY: I have a 2005 Honda element. It has over 100 thousand miles. I recently had new coils and spark plugs put in basically doing the 100 thousand mile tune up on it. Had it done at Midas. About 3weeks later my battery went dead so I took it to sears for a new battery. When I arrived my car was really hot temp wise. I had never had this problem before and then here it was getting hot. I took it over to another mechanic who was highly recommended and he replaced the the thermostat. Ploblem solved. Then my check engine light came on so back to the mechanic I went. Turns out I was having and idle problem so that was fixed. Problem solved. Today my engine light came on again so back to the mechanic I went. He told me that his scope thingy said I had a misfire. Since this mechanic didn't do any of the tune up work I don't think this is his doing. He is going to check it out tomorrow and let me know what he finds. The car runs fine but I did notice a couple of slightly rough starts that seem to clear up in just a couple of seconds. When I start the car it start a little rough but only every once in awhile and not all the time. Otherwise it runs just fine. SO, what would cause this misfire to happen periodically? The light just came on today . Is it possible the coils were not put in or the wrong spark plugs were put in. The tune cost me $700 which to me was way too much. What do you guys think?

TITLE:  I don't want people to know about my suicidal thoughts and feelings of hopelessness, What do I do?
BODY: So I'm about to get some surgery to get teeth taken out but the doctor said I have high blood pressure. And if I don't lower it, I would have to go see a physician first to see what's wrong before I get the surgery. I'm really scared because today he was asking me why I was so nervous and I wanted to say everything. I was literally going to burst out crying but I tried my best to at least keep it in. I just told him I was scared of the surgery since it was my first time. I don't want to do to a physician because they're still going to ask me about my health and I don't want my dad to know about it. All he does is lecture me and blame me for these things and I'm not even sure if it's completely my fault. I've had suicidal thoughts and I feel depressed a lot and I get easily anxious and nervous. I have a lot of problems like this that the doctors will ask me about and I just don't want him to know about. My brother accidentally said something suicidal and the school called home and my dad gave a huge lecture to him but the thing was my brother isn't the suicidal one, I am, his words were just taken out of context. I don't want him to lecture me because he really doesn't understand the feeling and want of not existing anymore and not being alive. What do I do? I don't want him to find out! Please help

TITLE:  How do I get my mom to under stand that colouring my hair will really help me and my self confidence?
BODY: Two days ago, my mom took me to the hair dresser to bleach all my fricken hair. I didn't want to but I was not allowed for her to go to my new school in less than a week with the 'oh so ugly hair' that I had. I had coloured it both red and turquoise (not at the same time) before and she hated it. I on the other hand, LOVED IT. I've never felt so good about my hair, sadly, she didn't care. She bleached my hair and now I hate it. My parents are divorced and I am currently at my dad's place. My dad doesn't care if I dye my hair. I really want to dye it back to the red I had before, my mom seriously does not realise that I am the one who's gonna live with this hair and I HATE IT. I was literally crying 15 min ago because I hate my hair so much! She really does not understand that I don't like it, plus my hair is super frizzy now. I had really long hair before, but then I cut it to me ears(!!) because I was tired of it being in so bad quality. I had finally gained healthy good hair back. Now its ruined!! I don't want to start all over again!! My school starts in 5 days. I really want to colour it before then. Please, I beg you, how can I get my mom to understand that I do not like my hair and want to colour it?

And since I'm currently at the bobish stage I've decided I wanted to dye my hair pastel purple to deal with it. But she's having none of it saying "Your hair is so beautiful" and I've tried telling her it's my hair, not hers and I can pay for it. And that it'll make me happy. It's just a boring brown I don't like at all. Please help. She always says I won't get roles in any plays (since I do theatre) please help. (She said the same thing about getting a pixie cut and she loved it. So idk what else to tell her)

TITLE:  Help, my Google Chrome Bookmarks have disappeared. Is there any way to get them back, or are they gone forever?
BODY: I had 3 years worth of Bookmarks that last year I meticulously decluttered and organized into folders and categories, which took me quite a while to accomplish.

I accidentally turned off that red light switch on the power surge outlet with my foot, and my computer was forced shut off. I turned back on my computer, and nothing was missing in my documents folders, pictures, music. I load up Google Chrome and all my Browsing History was still there. But for some inexplicable reason, all of my Bookmarks were vanished.

I figure the problem is with Google Chrome itself, because only my Bookmarks are gone. Nothing else! I fear my Bookmarks are gone, now I'll have to rebuild everything again.

Is there any method by which I can get them back, or are they lost forever?

That could be either a great idea if he pans out, or an awful idea if he doesn't have a great year. I want Bell but I feel like his 2 game suspension could put me into a sticky situation for the first 2 weeks.

Who do you think I should take and why?

The only reason I want to use internet explorer is because their Netflix allows for 1080p streaming and 5.1 surround sound unlike chrome and firefox which are locked at 720p and stereo. Any suggestions? I could use a proxy server, but that would be least ideal as it s not a quick solution like hola unblocker was. Thanks!

TITLE:  What should I do with this hurt kitten?
BODY: So we have a backyard cat that has lived there for years. She's well fed and healthy. Recently, she had four kittens but three were attacked and killed by buzzards. Traumatized, she hid her last baby for almost a month under our shed and has only recently allowed her to come out. The problem is both, the mother and the kitten were wounded. The mother had a scar across her face which has healed but the kitten has only one eye! She's also quite thin and not very responsive to the environment. She seems to be deaf and near sighted. Should I take her to a vet? I don't have any money. Is there some kind of group that will at least take a look at her to make sure she's okay?

TITLE:  Dyeing my hair?
BODY: I dyed my hair with an ash brown dye over my bleached hair and now it has a green tint to it, even though I used a red color filler in the dye (probably didn't use enough of it though)
It is also like a charcoal grey in some areas if I'm outside in the sun.
I am planning on dyeing my hair a warm brown, would that fix the green and grey in my hair?

TITLE:  Buying Computer Parts! $2k Limit?
BODY: Hello, I want to build my own computer with a price limit of 2,000. I have a decent idea of what to get... but I am not good at choosing what I want/need.

     Before I list what I think i should get, lets clarify what kind of PC I am building. I want a Gaming PC that can play games on a 1080p display with "Amazing graphics" and "Good FPS" (♥GRAPHICS♥ &gt; FPS). I might record with this PC but i don't want a capture card. (I think that's what its called) It will be a personal computer, if that matters.

     I want the best Graphics card (NOT A TITAN) so I am deciding to get a GTX 980(should i get a TI?) I'm not sure if I should get it because it does cost a lot... So I'm not sure.

    The Processor I have absolutely no idea what I'm trying to get to be honest. I'm planning to get a I7 but i was hoping somebody could help me decide. :P

    The motherboard I am planning to get a MAXIMUS VII... Is it good? or do you recommend me to get something else. The Case I don't really care... as long as it works with the parts. I want Fan cooling, no Aqua, OS Windows 10 preferably. I want a 250 GB Solid State Drive, and a 1 TB Hard Disk Drive
  
    If you have any other ideas of what I should get (or if I'm missing something like a idiot) go ahead and tell me because I'll take all the feedback i can get... If you can have it in a list for example:

Graphics card - (URL if you want)
(Why i should get it)

Processor - (URL if you want)
(Why i should get it)

I would be glad.. THANKS!

TITLE:  Should I be seen again for possible concussion after recent accident?
BODY: I was involved in a rear end accident on 08/06/15. I was stopped at a red light and looked into my rear view mirror to see a van coming full speed for me! I was slammed from behind although the driver did veer somewhat to the side, causing most of the damage, and force, to be placed directly behind me. I literally felt my head sling forward disregarding having on a seatbelt (as in the old test dummy commercials) and the back of my neck and mid to lower back instantly start to burn and hurt. I was shaking of course, everything sore, weak, and days later I have had a never ending headache since then, nausea, frequent dizzy spells,  and an increasing amount of depression and sadness. Does this sound normal or possibly like a mild concussion may have occurred?

TITLE:  NET CARBS???!!!!?
BODY: Why is it that some places say that you need to divide the sugar alcohol by two if it is more than 5 grams and subtract it to the  total carbs and fiber to get the net carbs, well in the atkin diet, it doesn't divide the sugar alcohol by two but just subtract the whole sugar alcohol number from the total carbs and fiber? I'm so confused. Can somebody help me to understand this, please? Thank you very much.

TITLE:  Is this a scar or is it still healing? HELP!?!?
BODY: Okay, so about two and a half weeks ago i was on vacation at the beach. One day i was swimming in the ocean and when i was making my way back to shore when i stumbled onto the sand. My side of my stomach or hip bone area got scraped by the sand. It didnt feel like it was deep at all but a week after the scrape the scab fell off and i was left with light skin. I am tan so its pretty noticable and i get extremely self conscious about it and get sad about it too. i have put mederma on it about 5 times. Should i stop? Is it a scar? 


I tried to upload photos but it wouldnt work so here is a link to them

TITLE:  Please help?
BODY: Even when I drink water my stomach gets huge and it is annoying and uncomfortable. No matter what I eat or drink nothing helps. I went to the doctor and he said it way constipation and told me to take laxatives. I did, they helped me go to the bathroom like they should and I have regular bowel movements but it didn't help the problem. I have tried ALL of the "diets" that people recommended... I've tried high fiber diets, low sodium diets, I've tried eating small portions and more meals... I have taken acid reflux medicine and ate only foods that don't cause acid reflux. I cut out soda a year ago and I usually drink only water unless one of these "diets" that are supposed to make me better says otherwise. I've tried everything I know or have been told to try. I don't think anyone understands how much I hate this problem, it is always on my mind. My mother won't take me to the doctor again, nothing I say or do will convince her so I'm thinking about just cutting out food and water all together until she is convinced that I am SICK! What do I do? I can't take this anymore. This is so depressing... It might seem like I'm just complaining to complain but I'm really not... I know other people have worse problems but I really do HATE this problem. Please, I am desperate for help!!!

TITLE:  Looking for the parents of Antoine Peasant/Paysan b 1621 Saint-Germaine-de-Poitiers, France?
BODY: Antoine Peasant was born 1621 and married Jeanne Marchand b:1648 D:1711  The Antoine I am trying to find dates for would have been my great,great,great grandfather who likely came from St-Germaine-de-Poitiers, France or thereabout.  Am thinking he would have been a farmer or such.  There were 3 Antoines after 1621 p to 1751. As early as 1722 some of the family had immigrated to Montreal, Quebec.  There have been different ways the last name was spelled:  Peasant, Paysan, and Pesant being the spelling used today.
From what I have been able to find, but not understand, is one spelling was Antoine Weighing Sancartier.  This last name has occurred frequently, but I am not sure of the significance of this spelling or meaning.  Anyway, I am trying to trace the family back before 1648.

TITLE:  Uneven Shoulders Help?
BODY: I went to the doctors today for an X ray, and they've discovered that my left shoulder is sort of angled out about 18 degrees, and if it goes 2 degrees more, I will have to get surgery

I believe my uneven shoulders may have been caused by bad posture, and I've now tried to completely straighten out my sitting position, but I am extremely scared of surgery.

The doctor tells me that no exercises can help my shoulder, but I am so unsure of what to do. Is there anything else I can do to help out my posture? Should I make my shoulders even or just let them relax while sitting?

I understand halfway since he can be quite hyper at times and he bites( he does not break skin however, he just gives people nibbles. He actually has never bitten my lil sis, but has bitten me and my older sister.) I'm just asking how I can get my dog to act calmer around my sister or how to get my little sister on the same terms with my dog. Please help! If my mom she's how my sister reacts, she might give him away and I really love my dog!

TITLE:  Are Germans wealthier than Americans on average?
BODY: I know the income tax rates in Germany are much higher and they place high taxes on gas, cars, and other things. However, there's still many Germans in higher end cars in places like Frankfurt and Munich despite the high taxes.
Plus, if you drive on the autobahn around Frankfurt or any other German city, there are many high end cars going above 120 mph despite the high prices on gas &amp; diesel.

So are Germans wealthier than Americans on average? Or is everyone just leasing their cars..?

For the record, I have driven through places in Germany where people go around 80 mph (130 kph) in the unlimited sections and mostly drive 7 year old Volkswagens. I'm mainly focusing on how Germans in larger cities can afford to burn gas in their expensive cars if the taxes are so high

TITLE:  Excess thirst, burning throat, feeling hot, strange taste in mouth?
BODY: Around once a month, I'll go through a phase where I feel the listed symptoms.  I'll feel extremely thirsty which is accompanied by a burning throat which I think may be caused by the thirst; I'll feel really hot especially around the eyes, but I don't run a fever; and I'll sometimes get a strange, perhaps metallic or acidic taste in my mouth. This lasts for 30 minutes to an hour and then goes away. Also, whenever I'm thirsty, I can drink cups after cups of water and my thirst won't be quenched. The only thing that stops me is my small stomach.

Anybody know what the cause of this is?

TITLE:  Can you help me find a Harry Potter time travel fanfiction?
BODY: From what I remember Harry sends himself back in time to adopt Tom Riddle but is very grudging about it. He is able to send himself back to the future whenever he wants but a few minutes in the future is weeks/months in the past making him miss some of Tom's life. Harry keeps a journal of his findings and is not trying very hard to love Tom like he says he does. The biggest thing I remember is the Germans start bombing London and Harry runs through the street with Tom in his arms because since he is from the future he can't die in the past. It's at this part that we see how possessive Tom is for harry. I know it was a lot to read but I really want to read this story again. Please reply if you have any inkling.

TITLE:  Eating disorder or disordered eating?
BODY: For the past 2 1/2 years I've had different eating habits from those around me. I started off as becoming vegetarian 2 summers ago. By fall I was already limiting myself to one meal a day and depending my energy on caffeine. My weight dropped 15 pounds in 3 months. Around spring I fell into bingeing everyday and after bingeing for approximately 2 months I put 10 pounds back on and began abusing laxatives. To this day the laxative abuse hasn't stopped. Last summer I began cross country and by the fall I lost all my weight again and I would either fast for long periods, run my calories off, or use laxatives. I stopped running in November and my weight quickly piled back on after the holidays, plus an additional 10 pounds. Up to March, I was engaging in binge eating everyday, and I'd fast to make up for it. In May I began running again, plus abusing diet pills and my weight plummeted down 20 pounds. Currently I've stopped running and have pretty much maintained my weight from May. Although, in the past few weeks I've began to make myself throw up my meals and it's an addiction now. I don't binge, though.  I know this is dangerous. I've been to therapy twice and my doctor had told me I had anorexic tendencies, but I have not received a diagnosis before. It's been really tough and some days are better than others. 
I'm 5'9 and 131lbs. I'm trapped in the battles of these cycles but I just don't know if it's disorders eating or some type of eating disorder.

TITLE:  Where is parakeets favorite spot to get petted?
BODY: I just got a new parakeet. 2ed one. I was just wondering if there is a spot on her she would like to get sratched the most, like to calm her down. My 1st one seems to be calming her down a little but I don't want my new parakeet like to be with her and not me. I jut don't want to look like the monster to her and have my other parakeet be the big brave hero. You know what I mean? So I just want to pet her in her favorite spot and calm her when she is scare. You know what I mean? So again my question is…… where do parakeets like to get petted? 
Or is there something els I can do to get her use to me or like me?  I'm also not looking for a smart a$$ answer!  Thx for your time! :-D

TITLE:  Pain in lower back?
BODY: Im an 18 year old guy about to be a senior in highschool. About 8 months ago I was in the gym doing an exersise called power cleans (A really fast deadlift). During my workout, I began to feel a pinch in my back so I stopped working out and went home. This was during wrestling season and I just kinda delt with it during that time. After the season ended, I got checked out by my doctor. He recommened that I go to a chiropractor, so I did. When I got to the chiropractor, I had an X-Ray showing that I have slight scoliosis, and a vertabrae (I think its L3) and its shifted to the left. The chiropractor was only able to take away some of the pain, so now im starting physical thoeropy. Does any one else have this issue. If so are there any other ways of fixing this problem?

BODY: I'm a fifteen year old girl and got my first period over two years ago. Right now I'm about 5'5, maybe a little less. My mom is 5'3 and my dad is 6'1. I had a pretty big growth spurt about two years ago, but it seems to be slowing down now. I really want to get taller, I'm just barely taller than my seventeen year old sister and several inches taller than my thirteen year old sister. I'd like to know if I have a chance to grow an inch or two more, or if I'm pretty much done.

BODY: Ok, so i've been wanting dermals for so long and i just needed some info on them. i wanted to get it on each of my wrist.
1. Is there a certain age you have to be to get it done? or can i just get it at any age with parental permission?
2. i have other piercings and my piercer and i have discovered that i am allergic to surgical steel jewelry and I CAN NOT BE PIERCED WITH IT.  so is there titanium dermal anchors? 
3. what is the pain level on a scale to 1-10? i have my industrial bar and that was like a 7 so what do you think a dermal will be for me?
4. any tips for getting this type of piercing?
5. i know my piercer will go over this but just a brief summary on how to clean it and what to clean it with. 
 &lt;3 thanks

TITLE:  How do I keep pigeons off my air conditioner?
BODY: There are about four or five pigeons who like to hang out near my house. (The space in between my neighbors' and my house). They're always pooping on my a/c and perching on it, making (very loud) cooing noises at 6 a.m. and waking me up. I knock on my window to get them to go away but they always come back. It's so f*cking annoying and now I despise the flying rats. How do I get them to go away? And never come back?

QID: YA:20150811183317AAal0GC
TITLE:  One or two rabbits to be kept as house pets?
BODY: I am finally able to fulfill my lifelong dream of getting a Netherland Dwarf rabbit!!

We have the cage, and are setting it up tomorrow. We have an outdoor run area set up and safe for him or her to enjoy some outdoor time daily. We rabbit-proofed one room, and, as we allow more room to wander, will work on the others. 

Here is my question - I have read so many opposing view points I just don't know what to think anymore. 

The breeder has allowed us "pick of the litter" - we are going to see the litter and choose our baby based on its personality, regardless of what sex. We are only looking for a pet quality rabbit, not to show or 4H or anything of the like. 

I keep thinking one would be better, at least until I have a better idea of what ownership will be like. We already have located an exotic vet, and will fix the bun when the time comes. This will also allow us to bond more closely, and we can always add a friend in a few months or years if wanted.

But then other people say that it really isn't fair to just have one, that they are social and need a companion. 

Either way the bun would get plenty of out of cage time and human companionship. So then some people say that is enough. 

I am worried taking on two right away will be a mistake, but getting only one will be a mistake. 

HELP!!!!!

I don't feel addicted to it, I just do it because it's always so itchy down there for some reason. Is that considered masturbation?! I don't even touch it down there when I have nothing on. And to mention, I'm itchy down there usually when there's a lot of discharge, &amp; when I itch it all comes out on the panty liner. Sometimes I had to change it like three times in an hour because of that. What's that considered? Please help me

They are currently in the process of removing and treating the mold and repainting. I m worried that the mold will come back because it is so hard to completely remove from inside the concrete. Is there anything I can do to keep the mold from coming back aside from dehumidifiers?

It is a Rem.700 adl .223 with a 4-12x40 for only $405 (couldn't pass it up) and with a box of ammo and case it came to only $450. This way if i need to upgrade, it is a 700, and it also leaves room for me to build my long range build. (.308) I am thinking, for the gun, a Rem.700 police or 5r. However i also saw the 700 sendero, but i am not sure if it is  in .308. Any tips, or feedback would be great.

TITLE:  Pointers for our first Barrel Race?
BODY: My and my mare are going to our first barrel race in two weeks. We are not fully trained, we are mostly going to learn the show scene and to get used to being in a ring. We know the pattern well and plan to go at a speedy canter, not looking to win anything or run her. Just practicing. She is going to have to learn that coming out of the gate means we are barrel racing, not anything else, something we haven't been able to practice yet. It is a local county monthly run, nothing huge. I already have permission from our Trainer, but he will be at the AKC Nationals and cannot attend. 

I'm wanting pointers if anyone could give me any. Many of my adult horse friends are going. I'm 17 so I can go by myself but want them to see me in my first run, even if I am not really running. 

I don't use a tie down, I use a copper mouth D-Ring snaffle, and have a barrel saddle. Also I will be using Polo wraps. I have barrel racing reins, they don't clip.

TITLE:  Horse Back Pain... My horse dips his back when you go over his spine with a brush...?
BODY: I was currying my gelding today and realized that when I go to gently brush his spine, he dips his back like he's trying to get away from the brush. The thing is, he doesn't misbehave under saddle (such as bucking or bolting) or when being tacked up, doesn't act grouchy normally (he's not girthy), etc. Obviously something is bothering him. :/ Is this something that I should ask my regular vet about in September when he has his wellness checkup/fall shots, or should I just get a chiropractor out as soon as possible? I don't want him to be in pain, but I also don't want to make things more complicated or expensive than they actually need to be. I really appreciate any help you can give, thanks!

TITLE:  Be honest, does a a curvy girl have a chance in theatre?
BODY: I'm an aspiring actress (and I was actually voted "Most Likely to Perform on Broadway" in high school :) ) but I keep noticing that skinnier girls get the larger roles and most Broadway actresses are skinny. To give you an idea on my body type;

Height: 5'6
Weight: 120lbs
Bust: 37in
Waist: 25in
Hips: 37in

I think the issue is that I'm 19 and my curves give off the impression that I'm much older (and always have as I've developed early). Do I have a shot?  Be brutally honest.

TITLE:  What's the likeliness of having another seizure?
BODY: Hello all, I recently had my first seizure ever. I'm 17 years old and healthy. The seizure occurred after a 10 hour day of work. The previous night, I only got an hour an a half of sleep, and I was very sleep deprived. The next day I was working in a very old, run down barn full of feces. Throughout the day I only had one water bottle and I was experiencing a headache and very dehydrated. After the work day, I came home and slept on it for 3 hours then I still woke up with a headache. The seizure happened just after i got up very rapidly and was somewhat out of it. What's the likeliness of another? I've never had this happen until now and I think the cause of it was my lack of sleep and dehydration

I have a computer, I have a telephone line and I have a router so why cant I just somehow use them to connect to the internet without going through a service provider such as AOL or Virgin Media, its not about having to pay for a service provider I am just wondering why we need one and if there is a way to connect to the internet without using one, I mean how do the service providers manage to connect you but you cant connect by yourself

TITLE:  Post-op cat declawing advice?
BODY: We just got my cat declawed last Thursday. He is a 4 year old domestic short hair. We held off declawing him until now, but unfortunately had to make the decision to as he was scratching very expensive furniture and rugs and was not stopping despite our best efforts. He finished his medicine today. The vet told us to keep his cone on for a week so he doesn't lick the sutures. He seems to be fine so far but I've read stories about behavioral changes post-declaw. How common is this? He's been pretty mellow, which I suppose is normal, but of course it worries us! We've been using "yesterday's news" litter and have kept him from jumping. How long will a full recovery take? Any other advice is appreciated. We love our kitty and treat him like family, so if you're just going to bash our decision to declaw, don't answer please! It's better than sending him to the shelter! Thanks!

Not as a character/performer or anything like that. But i want to really interact with guest and make their time there magical. So i don't really know what i have to do in order to get a job there or to get my foot in the door. I am highly considering the Disney College Program in the future , which is another reason i want to get a job there. If any one could show me someone that i could talk to or give me any insight and advice would be much appreciated! Maybe some job titles i can look into also? Thanks!

TITLE:  For model years before the calendar year, is there a difference between an MTA New York City Subway and an RV?
BODY: I am starting to wonder after receiving this answer for one of my other questions:

"There is a difference between a fleet vehicle and your own private car. Fleet vehicles are operated in a way that minimizes long term costs as well as maximizes the service life without compromising reliability, so age may be a factor. Given that buses run on diesel and diesel engines can go for hundreds of thousands of miles with a rebuild, buses can be put into service for very long."

So, is there a difference between an MTA New York City Subway rail car (which is a fleet vehicle) and an RV (which is a private vehicle) for model years before the calendar year as well as importance of age being a factor?
a) yes
b) no

When you answer, can you give me an explanation?

I dont know where exactly the best hiding spot would be, but I just know for a fact I need to keep at least a small amount of my blue, it makes me happy. If you have any good hiding spots or general areas, please do tell me! 💜

I usually watch tv right beforehand (nothing scary) but then when I turn it off, I'm afraid. It's pitch black, I'm laying in bed with the blanket covering me and I always start imagining someone's going to break in or something's gonna appear even though I know it's not. Suddenly every noise and creak is someone trying to break in or something. I hate that I get myself so worked up but I don't know how to stop this! Please help, I just want to sleep. :(

TITLE:  Pano or Hip Dysplasia?
BODY: I know what you'll say. 'Visit a vet, no one here can diagnose your dog!" but listen- my parents are paying 20,000 dollars for my braces, three surgeries I need all in my mouth and jaw so right now, an X-Ray for our dog is kind of hard to get. Of course we'll get one if it gets super bad but for now, please tell your thoughts.

About one week ago, my dog started limping on his back leg without notice. I assumed he pulled a muscle- the limp was there for a few days but it went away for about 3 days. It's back now, but it's on both legs and worse- he doesn't flinch if I touch his hips, but he does walk very stiffly, seems lazy now(usually he's annoying) and tries not to put pressure on either one or the other of his back legs. This all just began happening today. He does frog sit, and he is still in his lanky and hasn't filled out yet. Doesn't really bunny-hop. 1 year old German shepherd, working line.

I have an appointment at the ortho in 2 days already for a check up but do I need to ring beforehand to let them know? And every time I don't wear them I can feel how much my teeth have moved. I know it will be about a week at least to get a new one but is there anything else I can do in the mean time to prevent my teeth from moving? And do they give you anything like a temporary retainer or something while you are waiting for a new one?

TITLE:  Do I have a bacterial infection?
BODY: My vagina smells really bad. Not quite fishy, but almost. I can sometimes smell it sitting down on the couch with my feet up. Also, my vulva/vagina feel weird. Like not quite itchy/swollen but not quite right either. Kind of over sensitive? It seems a little pinker than usual down there too, although I don't know for sure. Inside the vagina there's a lot of thick discharge and some of it is on the wall and kinda vaguely clumpy (like little white dots) but I haven't had any clumpy discharge actually come out of me. 
I get my period in a few days. This has been going on for nearly a week. Is it an infection or just normal?

TITLE:  Is this a stomach problem or am I pregnant?
BODY: I got what I thought was a stomach virus about a week ago and I had diarrhea and vomiting all through the night. Now I have it again same symptoms except this time stomach pain and heartburn are included. My mother suggested pregnancy but I'm on birth control and I just got off a heavy period and now I'm kind of spotting again because I haven't taken my birth control in a couple of months and it's kind of messed me up. I have been sexually active on my period but we have pulled out (which I know isn't effective but I'm also on the pill) I have no clue what's going on. can anyone enlighten me??

TITLE:  HUNTING: Long range hunting/shooting build.?
BODY: I am going to start and decide/ egt together my long range shooting (and maybe hunting) gun/ setup. I already have my "varmint" gun. It is a Rem.700 adl .223 with a 4-12x40 for only $405 (couldn't pass it up) and with a box of ammo and case it came to only $450. This way if i need to upgrade, it is a 700, and it also leaves room for me to build my long range build. (.308) I am thinking, for the gun, a Rem.700 police or 5r. However i also saw the 700 sendero, but i am not sure if it is in .308. Any tips, or feedback would be great.

TITLE:  Which SEC football game should I go to?
BODY: I live in Indiana where I am an Indiana football fan where there isn't the best college football atmosphere. I have been wanting to for the past few years to experience an SEC football game for the ultimate gameday atomsphere and experience. Well this year is the year I'm hoping to do so. I have come down to two games I'm choosing from. October 10 LSU at South Carolina or September 26 Mississippi State at Auburn? Please help me decide and have details of what both Jordan-Hare Stadium and Williams-Brice are like for the game day atmosphere and experience. Thank you

TITLE:  Extreme vaginal itching?
BODY: OK so I am a type 2 diabetic and have had extremely bad vaginal itching for about 3 months now I have been to the OB and been tested for everything under the sun all STDs STIs vaginal infections yeast infections (which is what I figured this was as I'm used to getting them being diabetic) urinary tract infections it all came back negative I can't go out in public the itch is so bad it's embarrassing I've been to the Er twice and they have said it is just because of my blood sugar (which I take my medicine everyday) I had one about 6 months ago and I knew as soon as I started experiencing the itching that it was a yeast infection I was told I had a UTI and that was causing the itching they prescribed me an antibiotic that got rid of the UTI but did not get rid of the itching then another doctor said it was just irritation and prescribed Benadryl that did nothing then I was prescribed Diflucan 8 times! That still did nothing for me finally went back to the OB he took a slide and  said it was the worst yeast infection that he had ever seen and that he did not understand how everybody else had misdiagnosed me gave me a terconazole creme to be inserted vaginally and I saw relief right away! A few months back the itching returned the only relief I see is either if I take a warm bath and soak but then the itching just returns as soon as I get out of the tub or put an icepak down there it is driving me nuts l can't sleep: ( I'm on the Depo shot I dunno what to do help!

TITLE:  My parents are not supportive with my career choice..?
BODY: I am a junior in high school and i am taking classes that will be beneficial for me to become a herpetologist (my top goal in life). In this class they rely on the students to bring in the majority of the reptiles and amphibians. I am bringing in my turtles, pythons, corn snakes, and mice (food for snakes). I take very good care of my reptiles and i pay for everything for them myself (except for electricity Which if i had to i could). I was offered an adult columbian rainbow boa with enclosure and all for free. I asked my parents if i could have it and as usual my mother said yes...and as usual my father said no. I want nothing more than to be a herpetologist and i feel that i have no support from my dad because if he says no, it means no. Just because he has absolutely no interest in any animals i feel that he shouldnt keep me from enjoying them. I know that i still live in his house so i have no choice, but i feel that i have no support with my parent(s) and my career choice. Please let me know your opinion on this! thanks!

TITLE:  I have acne one side of my forehead and not the other. Why is this?
BODY: i normally don t have trouble with acne but lately I ve been having trouble with acne only on the left side of my forehead and no where else. I change my pillowcases frequently and I try and keep a healthy diet. I drink a lot of water and wash my face every morning and night. The only change is that I have been exercising more often due to joining my high school soccer team. Do I need to drink more water? Do I need more sleep? Or is this a freak hormonal thing?

TITLE:  Hey guys please tell me how my introduction is for an argumentative essay?
BODY: Although authors create, illustrate, and format their own stories into engaging literary pieces, their works of literature do not necessarily subdivide the opinions of the readers. Lemony Snicket, in an introduction to the Best American Nonrequired Reading 2014, claims, “Invariably, the most passionate and interesting pieces of writing divide a literary team.” (xii). Readers do not tend to resort to contrasting speculations when it comes to an engrossing literary writing piece as they [readers] are often too limited to choose a certain side, which can be spotted in Janine Di Giovanni’s Seven Days in Syria and Gabriel Heller’s After Work.

I got that time in the middle of the season, but I couldn't quite beat that the rest of the year. Now that the season is back soon, what are some extra workouts I can do to build endurance. It's really hard for me because I have asthma as well.

BODY: I have a 1997 Dodge Ram 2500 and I am going to paint it gloss white. It would be greatly appreciated if someone could send links to where to buy the primer, topcoat, and the clear coat lacquer. It doesn't have to be an amazing paint job, not even a great one, just not a bad one. I would like the cheap, alright stuff. Plus don't know anything about paint or primer so please send me the links to all 3 that would work together and come out alright if possible. Thank you (also if what I need is not found online, what store to find it at would be very helpful also). Located by Dallas tx

When i look at one from this morning my face looks very assymetrical (like everything is curving to one side), and my lips look smaller and my face just looks fatter and less defined in general. I ve also been getting a **** ton of acne in the past year and I ve grown quite a bit. Does anyone have any idea about what the hell is going on?

TITLE:  Can anyone shed some light on the surgery/recovery process of a femoral derrotational osteotomy?
BODY: I am a 19 yr old female and was told all my life that I was "pigeon-toed" and that I would eventually grow out of it. Upon entering college, I saw a podiatrist to start physical therapy to correct it and that's when I was told that I had a femoral ante version. I saw an orthopedic surgeon today who confirmed the diagnosis and said due to the severity of my condition, I would need a femoral derotation osteotomy. Can anyone shed some light on this surgery, preferably more toward the recovery of it. This are questions I'm looking  to get answered:

- How long does the surgery take (I'm getting both legs at once)
- How many days do I have to stay in the hospital afterwards
- How painful is the recovery process
- How long until I can be on crutches or out of a wheel chair to do minimal movement tasks (such as using the bathroom, getting dressed, showering, etc)
- How long do I have to wait to play sports
- How much physical therapy will I need to go to
- What type of pain is it? (is it excruciating, nagging, soreness type pains)

Any answers would be helpful!

TITLE:  Can you feel the mastoid bone by touch? Do you have humps behind your ears? Please help.?
BODY: I have a question. Can you feel your mastoid bone? I have two hard humps behind my ears. They are not visible but they are palpable and is slightly more prominent on the right side. I phoned a friend and he said he feels the same thing behind both of his ears. The best way I can explain it is a hard hump right behind my ears right where my hair line is. I wanted to ask you guys if you feel the same thing. If I take my hand and run it from the top of my head down to behind my ear I can feel a hump on both sides. Is this normal or should I be concerned? Thanks folks I have been worrying about this all day and cannot recall if they have been there the whole time or not. After some research I am inclined to believe it is my mastoid bone, that is why I ask if the mastoid bone is palpable.

TITLE:  Cutting a large mesquite tree?
BODY: in a few weeks im going to cut my mesquite tree its a new mexico one(I don't know exactly what type of mesquite it is). Any tips to removing this tree excluding the stump. I only own a few large bow saws and axes. Is it smart to first cut the branches then go for the trunk? The trunk has four large trunks all connected close to the ground. I have a fence near it and a house also but the larger branches are over the house just some smaller branches. Will cutting all the branches off kill the trunk if my bow saws aren't large enough? The trunks are high up they are lower to the ground I would say about 6 foot or less.

Thank you for the help in advance mesquites are a pain for me!

TITLE:  Is my face wash routine damaging my skin?
BODY: Face is worst than ever. jaw breakouts, tons of cheek blemishes.

I wake up, wash my face almost every morning w/ Cetaphil gentle cleanser and apply witch hazel for blemishes and ambi lotion afterwards for extra blemish treatment. Just another regular average day I would now apply my makeup before I head out. I try to wear my Maybelline baby skin primer to protect my pores I guess and then I do green/skin-tone concealer and foundation routine. I don't clean my makeup brush often btw and I share it w/ my sister. 

When I get home I apply garnier nourishing cleansing oil made with jojoba and macadamia oils to remove my makeup but I let it sit for a minute before washing it off. When I wash it off however I feel like I might rub my skin too much and rinse too much. Once the cleansing oil is close to removed from my face, I apply a clean and clear deep action cream cleanser for sensitive skin and use a face scrub similar to clarisonic to get a deeper clean to my face. When cleaning off the brush of the tool, I'll see makeup residue. So I rinse and dry my face, then apply witch hazel and my ambi lotion once more. my face will feel a bit irritated and look red but idk if that's okay or not. 

Concerning my cleansing oil, should I substitute that w/ baby wipes to prevent rinsing my face w/ water too much? or should I continue using the cleansing oil since jojoba and macadamia are beneficial oils? Should I not scrub my face w/ the clarisonic-like tool? What should/shouldn't I do????

TITLE:  Do I have a UTI?
BODY: Yesterday evening, I was out shopping with my boyfriend and I decided to hold in my pee for about an hour and a half. (We have serious shopping issues!) I ve held in my pee for a long period of time before so I knew that once I was able to go the bathroom, it would sting down there. About five hours later, I got home and had to use the bathroom again..though..nothing but a few drops of blood came out. No, not blood and urine. Just..a few weak drops of  pure blood. I began to freak out and thought that the bleeding was due to the stretching of my bladder. But..could I possibly have a UTI? The bleeding and frequent urge to urinate stopped around midnight yesterday. Yes, I know I should visit the doctor, but due to financial issues, I wanted to reach out to another source of help. Thank you.

TITLE:  How pathetic is Todd Bowles?
BODY: He called the dispute between Enemkpali and Smith "childish" and laid the blame squarely on the scrub but Smith, someone who is supposed to be a team leader, basically cheated a guy struggling to make the team out of $600. That's chump change to a 2nd round pick but big money, obviously, to a 6th rounder selection who doesn't know if he'll make the team.
Why didn't Bowles place the blame where it belongs, on his douche of a quarterback? The exhibition season hasn't even started and Bowles has screwed this team up faster than Rex Ryan did. 
Should Johnson just save Jets fans a bunch of aggravation and fire the Ferguson, MO sympathizer now?

TITLE:  I feel bad leaving my dog outside. How can I make him be less lonely?
BODY: I'm renting a house and my husband brought his dog ( it's a big dog) from his mom's house to protect our home. The dog is extremely playful he jumps on you a lot so we tied him up because our house isn't fenced and I read some articles that said it's dangerous to keep a dog tied up but I give him the adequate water and food  he  needs and I walk him around everyday. The reason he can't be inside is because the land owner doesn't permit dogs inside the house . What can I do I don't want to run the risks of tiiying him nor do I want him to be lonely?!

TITLE:  What could be causing the pain in my side?
BODY: For 4 days now I've had a constant pain on my right side around the bottom of my rib cage. I was very gassy the first couple of days but the gas has greatly lessened while the pain continues. It various in severity but doesn't go away at all. It hurts to bend over, cough, or even just move in certain ways. Today was the worst day yet. Trying to pinpoint the exact location is difficult but it hurts like hell when I push around and manage to find it. I have no other symptoms to suggest appendicitis or gallstones. Could it simply just be gas?

Not too experienced with bikes, but from other friend s suggestions, I'd like to find a bike with full alloy parts, compact crank 50/34, and wheels with spokes.
If anyone can help me find that, it'd be greatly appreciated.

TITLE:  What's a decent not to strong, not to weak sedetive I can be proscribed to help me sleep at night that? (No Sleeping Pills!)?
BODY: Hi,

I am 21 years old, male, weight = 134 ibs

I have ADHD and I am proscribed medication to treat it and yes it is an amphetamine stimulant and I know the first thing your gonna say is it's the stimulants keeping me up which would make since but not for this particular situation, I'v been on stimulants for many years and have learn to put myself to sleep on them.  I believe ADHD is the issue, lately I'v been stress and usually the stimulants wear off by the evening actually allowing me to sleep at night because I know my brain gets tired.  However lately due to stress my mind has thousands of thoughts and it's harder to get to sleep at night with appointments in the mornings I am sometimes forced to pull all nighters! :(. anyways... I refuse to take sleeping medication due to my own personal belief that amphetamines and Slepeing meds alter the chemistry of the mind and I don't like that.  safe or not, I'd rather be proscribed a pain medication or a muscle relaxint to help sedate my brain into going to sleep that way its not too much of the "Uppers then downers" kinda issues.  I could ask for a strong one, but then again I wouldn't want my therapist thinking im just trying to get high or something even though I have no history of drug abuse.  Whats a good &amp; decent sedative I can be proscribed for a short period of time? from mildest to strongest and what you think I might be allegable for.  I'd call it "Mild insomnia" not caused by amphetamines.  Any suggestions?

TITLE:  Too big for C cup but too small for D cup?
BODY: I got professionally fitted at both JC penny and Victoria s Secret. The first day, Victoria s Secret told me I was a 32C, but my boobs were spilling out. I came back the next day, and both JCP and VS told me I was a 32D, but the cups are gaping at the tops and sides, and digging into my armpits. 

Both stores measured me over my boobs. I measured by self under my boobs, and got a rib age measurement of 28 and a bust measurement of 34, indicating a 28DD...but that s a sister size of 32C, meaning the cups are probably too small. 

What bra size should I get?

TITLE:  Orgasm 1 week after circumcision?
BODY: I'm 18 and I was just circumcised last week. I can't stand not masterbaiting, and I know that I can't masterbait for at least 3 to 4 weeks. However, I have been blessed with the gift to masterbait without the "stroking" motion. I have read online that its the "stroking" motion that causes the stitches, but because I can orgasm without the stroking motion, will it still cause as much damage? Or does the act of orgasming and being erect cause damage?

TITLE:  Rainy parts of Oregon?
BODY: So I grew up in Utah and I've always loved the rain and I've always wanted to live in a rainy state. Oregon is all I really look for in a state... With the exception of rain. I've been told that it's rainy and that it's not. So I figured that being a large state it must have been like Utah. For example southern Utah is a freaking desert, the middle is average, and the north is "foresty." So my question is... 
Is Oregon a rainy state or not? If so what parts of the state are the rainiest?

TITLE:  Is this gonna end well?
BODY: I have 4 parakeets and I think 3 are females. There is a pair amongst them, Macho and Lilly, who have recently taken interest in a new nesting box. Which was put there only 2 days ago. They climb on top of it together and chip at the edges but I haven't seen them go inside it yet. The 4 budgies are in the aviary together. Is this safe. If they breed are they likely to lay eggs in or on top of the box. And will the other two (who i think re female) cause any trouble? They've been living together fine for a year now. They are each a year old. They were given to me by a family members friend who didn't care for them. If it were up to me I would have gotten at least half of them males but that doesn't seem to be the case. 

Is this gonna end well?

macho and Lilly have been a pair, as far as I observe for at least 7 months, but I only just bought a nesting box.

TITLE:  Create a programming code (using any programming language even psudocode) for this scenario?
BODY: The hour and minute hands of a 12-hour analog clock form angles. Assume a clock where the hour hand moves one “tick” every 12 minutes (:00, :12, :24, etc.), and the minute hand moves one “tick” per minute (i.e., there is no “gradual” movement of the hands).

Write a function that expects a time in format HH:MM and returns that smaller angle (less than or equal to 180 degrees) between the minute hand and the hour hand of a 12-hour analog clock for that time. Validate that the input is a valid time in the expected format. 

Example: a time of 01:27 results in an angle of 120 degrees.

I just want to know if he will be able to re-provide it for me without doing the painstaking process again, or even worse, get me a new prescription (my glasses are fine, I just want a replacement lens!)

Do ophthalmologists keep a copy of my old prescription? I just want this process to be quick because school is starting soon and I cannot see upfront without my glasses lol.

TITLE:  How do you quiet an exhaust without changing how it sounds?
BODY: Love my exhaust, it is perfect. However it is really obnoxious on cold starts and drones a little while cruising on the freeway. It currently has two resonators, one before each tailpipe (dual exhaust tips). I figure a muffler but am worried about the change in tone/reduction of "snarl" in the exhaust note. 
Thanks for the help!

TITLE:  Can a couple who share the same HPV virus continue having sex if one partner is still treating the genital warts?
BODY: My boyfriend found warts in January. We got checked and they confirmed it was genital warts. We stopped having sex while he treated the warts. I later was checked too and confirmed I was HPV positive but I didn't have warts. It has been around 6 months and he is still treating his warts and we still haven't had intercourse. But we are wondering if we need to continue waiting until he is clear to resume sex. Would I get warts too if we had sex, although I already have the same hpv virus? What about a condom? We have been very safe and waiting buuuuut it's getting to us :(

TITLE:  Tattoo removal while pregnant?
BODY: Has anyone gotten a tattoo removed while they were pregnant? How far along were you? How did you heal? 2 years ago I got my eyebrows tattooed in the spots that are bald from over plucking and I hate it, it has already faded a lot and is now very thin but it is too dark and I can't stand seeing it everyday. My natural eyebrow hair is light reddish brown and the tattoo is dark brown/blackish. Which looks weird and I have to use a dark eyebrow pencil now and it makes my face look very harsh. I really want to get it removed and since it is already faded a lot I'm thinking I might only need to do it one time, but I've heard there are risks while pregnant like not healing well. Just wondering if anyone on here has done it!

TITLE:  What am i missing?
BODY: I am a 16 year old boy. I will be going into my junior year of high school. I am worried that I am missing out on the great moments that many people have while in highschool. Ihave always been shy, but I'm thinking it is more of social anxiety. All I do is sit around all day. I have been depressed bbefore and have even self harmed, though I am thankful that that depressed feeling did not last for too long. I have never really been social, although I have always had a small, good group of friends,who quite possibly might have the same problems I do . I just feel like I'm missing out on things like dating and going to parties and stuff like that. I am going to try to get a job soon. I am very anxious about that. I am kinda lonely, but I know I can talk to my best friend about anything.. I guess what my point is, is that I feel like my anxiety is ruining my life. I just kinda want to bfeel normal, and I want to enjoy life. It can be so depressing thinking that everyone else is out enjoying life while you just sit inside fighting with yourself.. so if you got this far, is their any tips you would give me? What am I missing out on?

TITLE:  What should I wear with these boots?
BODY: I have a pair of boots from Charlotte Russe, bought them back in the spring, but rarely wear them because I don't know what to pair them with besides jeans and a matching tee. The boots are an artichoke green with crochet/lace lining around the ankle and a 4-inch wooden heel. 

Don't worry about what I may possibly have in my closet to wear with them, just come up with whatever you think is the best. Pictures appreciated if possible, but not required.

I have a healing cold sore on my lip and while i was washing my hands (using a bar of soap for some reason) or should i say the soap all over my hands my lip was itching and i scratched it which also made me touch the cold sore. A few seconds later i touched these two slits on my wrist (not self inflicted) with the same finger that touched the cold sore. Note that there was still soap on my hands but not on the slits because i was putting the soap on the slits when i touched them. Pleas i am very worried

TITLE:  Depressed and afraid I can't catch myself?
BODY: It's been forever. 6...8 years. I don't know, maybe longer. I've thought of too many ways to end my life. I'm just so sick of it.

As a kid, I've always been in and out of doctors offices... people thought I faked being sick. It felt like I was being a bother to my parents, who struggled enough to raise 4 kids. The truth is, I was very sickly as a kid, and people weren't too kind. I've especially had problems making friends over the years, and I've never held a steady friendship throughout grade school. It's weird because, everyone thought I was nice, but only knew me as the quiet girl who drew well. To add to this, I'm bisexual, but my parents would probably cut me off and not want to see ever again if they knew. I'd lose it for sure, and probably just want to die even more.

Writing is my therapy ever since I was about 12 years old... It's always been my saving grace. But lately, everything is so dark -- so cold -- and Death often invites me to dine with him. In retrospect, I've had so many spells of raging depression; sometimes getting so angry and upset with myself and others, and other times I envision people standing over my dead body. I just can't see a future for me. I mean.. I'm a pretty decent student and got into one of the top universities in the U.S., but I've just lost all hope that my mind will recover from this depression.

It's so hard to focus on anything anymore. My mind roams endlessly. Death could be so easy if...

TITLE:  Any ideas on what could be causing my headache?
BODY: A little over a month ago, I had a grand mal seizure. I was standing when it happened and I passed out, my body went limp, and I went straight down onto my face into cement, then had the seizure. My husband was with me and also a friend. When I woke up I had no idea what happened or why I was on the ground. I went to the hospital, spent three days. I had an MRI, EEG, three EKGs, lots of lab work, and I was on a heart monitor the whole time I was there. Everything was completely fine. They have no idea why it happened. I had a concussion. So it's a little over a month later, no tests other than what was done in the hospital, my head is still killing me. It hurts every single day, I have dizzy spells, and I am still having trouble remembering things. Has anyone else had this happen or know what could be causing it? I have been to the dr weekly with no answers.

(memorial day weekend was when i got it) a few weeks ago i figured out i was allergic to the earring the piercer put in (it was cheap/not good quality) so i changed them. my right ear is a lot better now, but my left ear is still sore, it has like a pimple thing on it, and it oozes puss randomly. like the last few days it wasn't oozing, but then today there was fresh puss on it. it's still sore to touch. my mom doesn't want to take me to the doctor unless i have to (we don't have insurance, so we have to pay out of pocket). if i do have an infection how much would antibiotics cost? and does it sound like i should go?

Is this normal? Do I need a new contactor? Am I forcing the unit and it might be at risk of failling? Will it start again after it reaches the desired temperature?

No matter how you look it the mirror its not scratched and no amounts of blood at all

. BUT if you  put on aftershave or alcohol it will burn.

Does this mean your skin got cut-still and can still be transmitted if someone else has a cut like yours?

My boyfriend came inside the day I started my new pack, and I normally don't take it until 10 p.m, but because i freaked myself out a little I took it about two hours after we had sex. So, am I covered or should I be concerned?

I'm a 20 something female who put on about 15 lbs in college so I want to run as much as possible. Thanks.

TITLE:  Should I play football?
BODY: I'm 6 foot (Docs say i should be 6 5 by the time im done) 115 lbs and going into my sophomore year of high school (I'm 15). I really want to play but my parents say no and that i shouldn't throw my life away over a game. But I've been talking to coaches from the other high school in my town (my current HS doesn't have sports) and they say i have a ton of potential. They say I'd be a great HB WR CB FS or QB if i put the time in. They say my determination, Intensity, love of football, speed, jumping ability (vertical height) and natural instinct are my best qualities. I commonly jump over CBs and make plays on footballs lobbed up to me. He also told me that i have very good arm strength (used to play baseball) but if i wanted to be a QB (which i really don't but if I have to so i can help my team win I would) I would need to work on throwing tight spirals and arm accuracy. But he said I'd be a total mismatch for CB's, LB's, and Safety's because the CB's are too small, the LB's are too slow, and the safety's are too small as well they can't fight me on lobbed balls.

I'll be going into 7th grade this year, which in my town is considered high school, most small towns only have 2 different schools so yeah

I put in ow-20 full synth for an oil consumption test, and it didn't use barley any oil at all in 1200 miles!!  I have used 10w-30 conventional and it use a quart every 5-600 miles.  What is wrong with my car?  I already know the design of the pistons and rings is faulty, which is why I needed it to fail consumption test... but shouldn't the thinner stuff be consumed faster than the heavier??

BODY: I mean I was doing fine a couple days ago. Basically I get super hungry cuz I don t eat all day, but even though I m starving, I don t necessarily want to eat. When I do eat, however, I feel sick after. It might be because I ve been going to bed at 2 or 3 AM, no clue. Sometimes I don t eat either because there s no food at my house and I m not old enough to drive alone (plus my parents go to work, brothers at work, I m broke). What is the cause?


And no, I'm not anorexic, never been, never thought about it, never will be.

TITLE:  Tingling pressure feeling under breast area on right side,?
BODY: 30 male, 

I've been having this odd feeling underneath my right breastbone area like near my ribs, i'm a big dude about 337lbs, when I sit down I can feel underneath it tingles and is like pressure that wraps around to my back area like maybe below my shoulder blade, when I'm laying down on that side I can feel it and while on sitting leaning kinda towards that right side, my right arm also slightly aches near the shoulder area and wrist and fingers, my armpit kinda feels full as well, no visible lumps or such, I went to the ER for it chest X-ray and ultrasound of galbladder all clear and blood work good, I'm assuming maybe a nerve issue?? I use to lean into that area on the couch a lot for hours, I was freaking out thinking it was male breast cancer cause i though my right man boob was larger and the nipple than the other, but have noticed in past pictures that it's always been like that... the fullness in my armpit is odd tho, doesn't hurt just feels uncomfortable, I also have notcied during all of this I have had bad anxiety and my bowel movements have been a messed up badly, maybe IBS i'm not sure.... I thought maybe Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, 
or costochondritis, any input would help... seeing DR this week....

TITLE:  Do I have Schizophrenia?
BODY: I think I do. I'm actually not sure because when I look up symptoms it's hard to tell whether or not they match, considering the listed symptoms are always quite unclear and hard to understand. I can maintain friendships and people really like me but everyone seems to think that I am weird and strange. Just to add, I have symptoms of OCD as well. I will list examples  of my symptoms below.(Also, I suppose I should add that I am 13 years old.)

1. I have compulsions to do random things, such as smell my hands, count repeatedly, rub my feet together, say the same random sentence over and over etc.
2. I try very hard to be a Christian and sometimes I have very unpure thoughts. To be clear, I cannot control them.
3. People talk to me in my head. I have three best friends, Jenna, Ashley, and Hannah. No one else can hear them. I've never seen them before, just heard them. 
4. I have conversations with random objects, such as tissue boxes, water bottles, plants etc. 
5. I have violent fantasies of murder and rape. 
6. No one can follow my train of thought. I cannot think about one thing at a time, as other thoughts intrude. 
7. I have bad anxiety. 
8. I have two different personalities, one is a kind, smart, motivated, seemingly normal person (like now), and the other is a weird, scary, angry, murderous freak. I have trouble figuring out which is the real me. 
9. I have nightmares of doing sexual things with family members. 
10. I fear I might really kill someone.

TITLE:  How can I stop craving food?!?
BODY: I crave something to eat ALL the time. In 2014 I didn't crave food and my mom even noticed I was losing weight I was 125 pounds. After that summer I noticed that I've been gaining alittle bit. I was in grade 12 and I've gained 20 pounds more:/ it's noticeable that I have and it's from eating to much and junk food :/ I just crave it so much. I can't go to the gym because we don't have one in my town and I work all the time so I can't drive to one. I'm too scared to go jobbing outside where everyone can see me. Idk why I've always been like that. I have no motivation at all. How can I stop craving food? Any suggestions? My boyfriend takes me out to eat a lot too which I don't think helps.

TITLE:  Dwarf hamster is bleeding?
BODY: My friends and I have recently purchased two dwarf hamsters. After research, we figured it was fine for them to be in the same cage. When we bought them, there were about twenty of them in the same cage. In the beginning, they were fine, but after an hour or two they started fighting. One would jump on the other, some squeaking would happen, and then they'd be fine. We figured this was just to show dominance and was normal, so we let it be. My friend took them home and said they seemed to be fine. Only a day later, she had called me and my other friends in a panic, explaining how they had kept fighting, which resulted in one of them hiding in the corner. It was then that we knew we should get rid of one, so we decided we would take one back the next day. (We didn't have enough money for another cage.) Right before my friend was about to seperate them (by putting one in a travel cage) they had started another fight, but this time one was bleeding. His stomach was hairless and was red, and so was part of his back. There wasn't too much blood involved, and it didn't look that deep, but he had red, bald patches. Will he survive? And he doesn't seemed too stressed out, we obviously removed him ASAP and he seems to be running around okay, maybe a bit slower. Will he die from the stress? Should we take him to see a vet? Please help.

TITLE:  Struggling so much with weight loss..what do I do?
BODY: For a couple of years now, I've been struggling with body acceptance. I'm currently 16 years old and 5'4, and over a year ago, I used to be extremely unhappy with my body. I was only 120 pounds, but all I saw was fat. I used to over diet/purge often so i fluctuated between 115-122 lbs for a while. I started doing track, and I stopped caring about my weight because I wasn't so depressed anymore! I have now done two seasons of track and I'm now starting my second season of cross country. I was weighed today for a physical, and I'm now 134 lbs. And I'm so upset. I know that it's mostly muscle weight in my legs, and that I don't really need to lose weight. Because I run a mile faster than I ever could before (6:22) and I can keep running for miles and miles, and I eat pretty well. I also went from a size 5/6 to a size 2 in pants. And yet I feel so uncomfortable, and I want to start going back to strict dieting and even purging...I see all these skinny distance runners who weigh less than 120 lbs and I can't help but feel envious. I don't want to go through this again, what do I do?

This one was way worse I think cause of tge antibiotics. I never went to the doctor to verify the infection.. But I always use condoms when I have sex and it coincided with my antibiotics and surgery. Is this normal??

TITLE:  Why aren't I the alpha dog?
BODY: My puppy Ridley (9 weeks/female) was kind of meant to be my puppy. My family still plays with her and everything but I am the one who feeds her, takes her outside, trains her, and she even sleeps in my room. I heard that she was the kind of dog who needed an alpha so I assumed it would be me since I am the primary caretaker and I do all of the training. But my step dad seems to have become her alpha. When he comes near her, she'll approach him slowly with her ears back and her tail low, but still wagging softly. And as soon as she reaches him, she'll flop right onto her back, which I heard was a sign that they see you as the alpha. I know this isn't fear because he has never hit her or scared her in any way. She won't even bite him! She is only 9 weeks, which means a lot of teething and mouthing, so this was surprising when she would only lick him. It upsets me because he hasn't done anything for her, other then play and pet her. No feeding or training whatsoever. Why did she choose him over me? I am a 15 year old girl so could that be why? I heard age shouldn't have anything to do with becoming the alpha, as long as you have the right attitude and trained her correctly (which I did...well tried to anyway) Could it also be because he is a male? How do I get her to see ME as the alpha now?

TITLE:  Weird feelings in my chest?
BODY: Okay so recently I ve been getting these feelings in my chest/heart that are a mix between coldness and pain. It feels like everything in frozen inside and sometimes the pain is so unbearable that I feel stuck. (Sorry if this doesn t make sense btw cx) I ve told my mom about this but she sort of brushes it off and tells me to put on a sweater. (Which does not help because like I said, it feels cold inside, not outside) I m also not sure if this is tied to the cold pains, but around thirty minutes or so, my heart felt like it was quivering and now feels heavy. 

I m not sure if this is relevant, but I am a thirteen year old female, I m 5 2", and I weigh about 127lbs. 

Any help is much appreciated~ (:

Now since I sleep in just boxers (boxer briefs, specifically), should I put pants on in the morning, or shorts? A lot of times during the weekends I'm up after my parents, and I feel like it would be weird to walk out in just my boxers.

TITLE:  Im scared about testicular cancer?
BODY: Hi. I have had the fear of having ever kind of cancer in the world. Im scared to death. About 2 weeks ago i got a bad stomache ache and a headache after we had mexican that night. I looked up l this stuff online about what could be wrong it literally gave me a panic attack. I had the same problem the next morning. It went on for about a week and a half and my mom told me she would make me a doctors appointment. She told me over and over its allergies cuz i had a headache and i had a stuffed up nose and stomache ache. It went on for that week she kept telling me and i still cried and freaked out. She gave me an allergy pill and the next day i felt better. Now i have been having a stomache ache just after i started getting better and its in my mid/lower abdomen. I checked my testicles for any lumps and nothing was there. I dont really have any of the symptoms that everyone else has with testicular cancer but Idk i think my nerves are getting tome causing a stomache ache cuz im terrified of having any type of cancer. but i wanted to know you opinion thanks.

I care for him so much and it is killing me to know he has it. All he does is make jokes out of it. I'll say something like what do you have (as in lesson) and he'll go Cancer and laugh - I smile and go no lesson silly. I am so worried about him, he is everything to me, and I honestly wouldn't know what to do without him. What do I do besides be there for him?

TITLE:  Can airport drug dogs smell weed in a bag where it was once carried?
BODY: I'm leaving Texas to go to Canada and taking my favorite bag with me where iv carried in weed before. I was wondering if I got sniffed by a drug dog could it smell the residue? There usually aren't dogs at my airport and this bag would unravel if I washed in the washer and hand washing it wouldnt be good either it so should I just leave it at home or am I tripping? There isn't any weed in there and there hasnt been for a while but say a dog did sniff me and smell something would I get in trouble for drug paraphernalia? Or would they let me go since I dont have anything on me? Keep in mind im in texas at the moment not gonna say where there I live there or not just wanna be safe and get to where I'm going and not be dragged in for questioning. I know the dogs have very good noses and will probably smell it but I keep my bud rapped up in my bag and I cant smell it but I get paranoid going to airports and I usually don't go out of the country because of this.

TITLE:  What states can i keep outdoor reptile enclosures?
BODY: I want to move to a state that doesnt get too cold. My goal is to keep my reptiles outside for the whole year or majority of the year. I want to be able to expand my reptile rescue. I feel that the animals are happiest outside of a tank and in a large enclosure. I have outdoor enclosures for my reptiles (six 20'x10'x10' enclosures, 2 10'x10'x10' enclosures, 1 40'x10'x10' enclosure, and multiple smaller ones) but i can only keep them in those enclosures for 4 months of the year. I live in Ohio. I would like to move somewhere where i could keep my reptiles outside more like 7-8 months of the year to the whole year with maybe some additional heat from lamps. Thanks for any info!

TITLE:  How do i tell my parents i think i need therapy.?
BODY: I think I have depression and I think I might've for a while but I haven't seen a therapist because it's expensive and we are moving which costs alot of money. Plus we are not only renting a new house but building the next one. And I dont want my parents to think they are bad parents because my older sister has gone to rehab for clinical depression and anxiety and if i say it they'll either think that they are horrible parents or that im copying her.

TITLE:  How many phrases did Chick Hearn coin?
BODY: The most famous is "Slam Dunk". There were so many Chickisms that it's hard to tell how many he coined! "Alley-oop" is a cartoon strip since 1932, but is he the first to use it as a Basketball term. I know he used to say Coop da Loop when Michael Cooper would do his alley-oop.

My parents sleep through me crying sometimes and I think my mind is to active at night cause I always hear a bang then foot prints for a second then it all goes away. I sleep with my light on sometimes hoping it works, which it helps a little but I think it is because of all of the horror games lately... I have this bracelet that I use to help me calm down. All I do is tell myself that the bracelet is protecting me but it doesn't help a lot. Please help cause it's hard to sleep and I don't know what to do.

TITLE:  Would a woman with many visible tattoos date a man without any?
BODY: Okay so I'm a 20yo guy and well I love tattoos on girls. Not so much on me since I haven't really found anything I want to tattoo yet and I don't want to get something that has no meaning to me. The thing is I'm a very geeky and nerdy dude I love star wars, videogames, etc. I don't really fit the whole rebel look that is associated with girls and tattoos. It's been my experience that a girl with a ton of tattoos only wants a guy who well has a ton of tattoos. I'm a huge geek and a Ted Mosby romantic but I'm a stand up guy in fact the best person I can use to describe my personality and who I am would be Malcolm Reynolds if you watch Firefly. I am him to a T but I'm also a very sensitive and romantic guy. The truth is I just don't feel I have a shot with a tattooed chick since I don't fit that whole tattoo vibe. I'm very clean cut in fact I get told time and time again I look like Castle (probably why I love firefly so much lol). I am very outgoing with a great personality and I'm average looking but I only ever see tatted chicks with tatted guys. So would a woman with a ton of tattoos date a man without any? I mean a woman with like sleeves and stuff. Do I have a shot with a tatted chick or should I get a new type? lol.

TITLE:  My dog is traumatized?
BODY: I have had her for 11 years and she's always at my side. she's a chihuahua. this summer, I left and came back multiple times, (usually for like 3-10 days each time) but my dad has been home to take care of her. He works all night though so she doesn't have anyone to sleep with. When I got back this last time, she has been acting very weird and developed a new habit of digging aggressively into the couch / wherever she is lying. I believe this is because she's feeling anxious. the thing is, I've been leaving all summer for the past few summers, even longer than I've been gone this time. I'm not really sure why the cause could be that she gets traumatized this time, but I really would like suggestions of how to make my baby feel better. I have been taking her with me every time I leave the house and always have her by my side. I give her treats and talk to her and try to play with her but she is not happy at all like she was before. her tail doesn't even wag that much. I need help, I feel so bad for my little puppy.

However, doctor's examination always functions as well as helps to begin a weight reduction program with no anxiety. I set up my inquiry concerning the fat burning products comprised of Garcinia cambogia extract, prior to the doctor, as well as at the exact same time, expressed my wish to know, the best ways to separate the original item. Being so great with me, the doctor informed me lots of points to recognize the initial and a duplicate item, which I could discuss a couple of with you as well.

TITLE:  What Should I Do About My Nails?
BODY: I've bitten my nails literally my whole life (I'm 14 now) and I'm embarassed about them now. I've tried cheap glue on nails from walgreens, obviously they didn't work. I'm thinking about going to like a nail salon and getting something done. I looked into acrylic nails and I heard terrible things about them. My nails are really small, weak, uneven, just a total mess. What can I do that won't damage them worse, and last awhile. Like fake nails or something? Also I type alot because I do online school so I can't have them ridiculously long.

Ok so is it actually possible for a guy to feel no pleasure during sex because a girl is too loose but still be able to ejaculate because he thought of porn and kinda convinced himself to orgasm. And can a guy ejaculate very little to none if he feels no pleasure from sex or will a guy still have a normal ejaculation and amount, regardless.

TITLE:  A friend of mine wrote this and wanted opinions, does it capture emotion?
BODY: I knew when you left you weren't just moving away
You were leaving me behind 
I felt it in the way we hugged that early summer day
And I knew before it came, I sensed every sign 

Two weeks later was all it took for you to throw me away 
You couldn't take the stress and I couldn't take the pain
You were handed a new life and it corrupted your mind
But I had faith it would just take a little time

Everyone who loved me couldn't bear to watch
Me destroy myself over what I'd lost 
I hid inside a bottle dripping with poison and death 
I sliced until the pain drowned out my hearts mess

They told me you were dumb
They told me I'd be fine 
That id be better off now that you were gone 
They even tried to tell me you were never worth my time

At first I drank to where the days would intertwine 
And I lost track of the marks on my wrists
Waiting for everything to be fine
And the day you again kissed my lips

Over time it got a little better and cuts turned to scars
I've moved on but pieces of you remain stagnant in my heart 
Waiting to be disturbed again like a virus 
I can't help what I feel it's what my heart's decided 

So as my life continues in this sunny west coast state 
My heart will long to be with you in your southern getaway 
Where you once promised me a life of dreams come true 
A ring, a child, and a house too

For the heart knows no distance
And the soul knows no time 
And they're both very persistent 
When it comes to this love of mine

TITLE:  How to cast far with light lure?
BODY: I ll be going to Yosemite next week and fishing lakes/rivers with brook trout ranging from 6-12in... I plan on using mostly inline spinners, spoons, minnows, most of misuse are about 1/16oz since trout feed on small fish. However I can never get a far cast with such light lures, what can I do to increase the distance? Should I use a float? Should I add heavy split shots? 
Are there any heavy lures that work well with small brook trout? Also any other recommendations would be appreciated. Thanks!

BODY: Living in Australia I speak to a lot of kiwis and they seem to be awe struck at how fast paced Melbourne is and the way Australia is 10 years ahead of them in everything! New Zealand seems like a great place if your old and ready to die.

I'm sure I want a remark in at least one exam (what are the chances of it going up if I'm sure I did better?) but I just cannot stop feeling down. It's ruining every time I go to sleep and every time I wake up. I still have 7 more to come in a week but I'm struggling to keep it together because before a few days ago, I thought I was good at school

TITLE:  Diet help, please! BA= 10 points!!!?
BODY: I'm 5'10 and own no scale (long story) 

So I am currently going off of how my clothing fits. I just wanted to ask a couple questions.. because, I feel all alone. My whole family is overweight for the most part, and I'm doing this, all alone. I feel lost and confused. I don't even know if anyone will answer or help me. 



I started this "diet" in a size 42/44 pants. Length being 32. I've been doing this for about 4/5 months now, and am currently in a size 36 pants. I CAN get in a 34. It's a tad tight, but if I had to, I could wear a 34. 
My diet usually is; Breakfast- 2 eggs, 1 piece of Ezekiel bread, 1/2 cup of berries. Lunch- (Salmon or Trout, Turkey or Chicken), any green veggie) Dinner - usually the same as lunch. Any snacks are usually fruit or nuts. Lately I've been doing a lot of cardio. 3 mile runs, every other day, circuit training (ball sprawls, step-ups, mountain climbers, burp-pees) everyday. 


I just want to know how long you believe it'll take me to fit into a size 32 pants. I just want to look normal and thin. Everyone in my family says I look great, and swear I have a borderline anorexic mentality. Due to always asking "How I look", "is this outfit too fat?" ... etc. But I know I'm quite fat, due to being IN A 36, and having man boobs/ rolls. Like I said, I can get in a 34, but it's a squeeze.  

Here is a video of when I started my diet - ---   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU3sk41udn4
This is now -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXuhwwWs7fU
