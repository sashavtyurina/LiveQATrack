TITLE:  My dad yells at me for wearing leggings?
BODY: I'm 16 and a sophomore in highschool. So I wear leggings a lot, especially to school. I'll wear them at least three times a week. They match with everything and fit my legs nice. My dad always yells at me for wearing them and says I can never wear them again because they're inappropriate. He tells me to wear jeans. Honestly, I would, but jeans give me a muffin top. I have like six pairs of jeans and they're all cute but they give me a muffin top and the only thing I can wear with them is a baggy sweatshirt. ALSO,  my public area like sticks out and it's really noticeable when I wear jeans. It's not as noticeable with leggings. I can't tell this stuff to my parents but that's why I wear leggings so much? I'm really short and it's hard for me to find jeans that fit me and don't give me a muffin top. I don't know what to do because my dad won't let me wear leggings

TITLE:  Do you think it's strep throat or something else?
BODY: I'm 16 years old and I've been having horrible headaches during the day and night, an earache at random times, and a slight sore throat? I just noticed that there are a couple red blisters in the back of my throat. My throat isn't hurting that bad, it's my head and ears that hurt. It's been going on for a couple months now because I thought it would just pass, but now it's getting worse. At the beginning of all of this I had swollen lymph nodes behind my ears, but they finally went down. It's been like 3 weeks since they went down and I still feel terrible. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow, but I was wondering if any of you might have an idea as to what it could be? Thanks in advance (:

TITLE:  Have you seen this kind of strange FB display? What can be done about this? Details below...?
BODY: A friend of mine looked me up on FB and here is what he found

Joe Smith
Single, interested in females

Joe Smith
Cleveland, Ohio

My listing was the one that said "Single, interested in females."

I thought that looked weird.  Can I just get my listing to say "Joe Smith" and no other comments under my name ???  I do want to keep the info single, interested in women in the "about" section on my FB page.  I prefer to NOT have home town or current city info on my fb page.

Thanks.

TITLE:  Pregnant wife found weakly positive TWICE with a local free clinic.Tested with a highly reputed lab and found Negative!. Gyno says NORMAL!?
BODY: Hi, 

I need help (Like everyone else out there!)

In 2011 and 2012 i had unprotected anal sex with two women who s HIV status is unknown.Now that I m married and my wife is pregnant 2015 (5 months) they have asked to get a HIV test.Test was done through a local free clinic and the results was shown a weak positive (Twice).

When we went to see out gyno, he said not to worry but to do a hiv 1 and 2 antibody test through the hospital that he work which is highly reputed and the lab results are widely accepted.

Her result came as Negative (Elisa) and after 3 days i also underwent the same test which provided the same result/method.

Can i be assured that both of us are HIV free after seeing the result? 

Glad if this could be answered by a Dr. I m so down with the situation and living with a heavy guilt for my irresponsible actions.Pls help me!
